Having been orphaned—twice—he's spent the last ten years working and staying out of trouble. His only aspiration is to save enough money to become an archhuman.<br /> <br /> His dream gets the jump on him when he barely survives a near-death encounter and finds himself in possession of 1% Lifesteal, a bizarre talent with numerous contradictions and just as many uses.<br /> <br /> With every dead enemy, he becomes a bit stronger, a little wiser, and a lot more ruthless. And no matter how much damage he takes, he can always put himself back together. Physically, at least.<br /> <br /> But on his path to power, after having to look at the rotting guts of archhuman society again and again, can his talent keep his mind and soul as pristine as his body?<br /> <br /> Or will that part of him simply remain broken...<br /> <br /> <b>Experience the start of this action-packed LitRPG Adventure from Robert Blaise set two hundred years after a reality-altering apocalypse. Featuring a weak-to-strong Brawler MC who never backs down, a unique power system, apocalyptic elements and more!</b></p>",

Because every room in this old Los Angeles brownstone has a mystery or two. Mysteries that stretch back over a hundred years. Some of them are in plain sight. Some are behind locked doors.

Fueled by atrocity against Mage and mundane alike, the secessionists who waged war against the Protectorate of Mars are finally defeated. Now, a special commission from the Mage-Queen of Mars takes Roslyn deep into the former Republic to hunt the architects of that atrocity. Mages who betrayed their own, the creators of Project Prometheus must be brought to justice. But hidden from even the Republic, Prometheus has woven magic and technology together once more. Here, hidden from all prying eyes, they have created a monster...one that even a Protectorate forged by the spell must call black magic.</p>",

The alien artifact working through its program under the clouds of Venus has appeared in Uranus's orbit, where it has built a massive gate that leads to a starless dark. Jim Holden and the crew of the Rocinante are part of a vast flotilla of scientific and military ships going out to examine the artifact. But behind the scenes, a complex plot is unfolding, with the destruction of Holden at its core. As the emissaries of the human race try to find whether the gate is an opportunity or a threat, the greatest danger is the one they brought with them.",

In the end, he stopped fighting it, realizing that he would need the social status to keep his promise to Myna and avenge the deaths at Oakwood.</p><p>Leaving Hearthglen behind, the family moved to the center of Queendom, the city of Accord. As the most important city in the Queendom, Accord had been Shaped from the ground up around the central tree that towered above every other structure in the city. The gigantic tree housed all of the city functions, and was the first project the Queens had undertaken on this world.</p><p>Sean and his family began to build the allies they could, knowing that Accord would see them dealing with more politics. Hallie set out to make allies with the lesser nobles—with the help of Dame Daria Iceblood—leaving Sean free to focus on his new healing clinic. After all, healing could give him the chance to win more people over.</p><p>Little did they know that the one they sought to undermine, Lord Truestrike, was already making strides toward his own plans. Soon, Accord would bear witness to two nobles vying to pull each other down…though hopefully without invoking the ire of the Advisor.</p>",

With oaths and promises in peril, should he breach that rank before letting people live their lives, Artorian will hustle and bustle to lay the groundwork for mass-decanting.

As all electronics in the world simply ceased to work, blue screens filled with information appeared before him.   Drew was given access to a mana interface and a limited number of reality-altering crystals called Xatherite. Following the instructions on his vision-impairing screens, he \"slotted\" his Xatherite and changed his fate: He gained the ability to cast spells. Now alone in the dark, he must battle through the government bunker turned dungeon in a desperate bid for survival.    Escape is only the beginning, the first of his many problems in the changed world. Drew will be tasked to not only survive...but to guide the rest of humanity safely through the anarchy.",

    "description": "<p>Gregory was beyond happy when his second year in the Magi Academy began. Now married to both Yukiko and Jenn, Gregory had more love than he ever thought he’d find. It was also a time for friends. Daciana and Nessa, their novice friends, found another in Victoria, who also quickly became close with Gregory and his wives.</p> <p>Gregory found still more friends in Clover and Ling, two clanless apprentices who shared his tactics subgroup. The eurtik-blooded magi were earnest and eager to learn, so they were quickly taken under the Aether’s Guard apprentices’ wings.</p> <p>With so many friends around him, Gregory felt the year was bright. The hatred of the Eternal Flame still pressed down on them—although the clan seemed strangely quiet during the first half of the year, the threat of violence was still there.</p> <p>The friends trained hard to fight as a unit, intent on being the champions to raise the clan’s name and reputation. The first tournament of the year came quickly, with a few surprises. The biggest was because of the merchant, Carlisle, belittling eurtiks. Hao Warlin suckered him into a bet that grew and grew until the merchant lost a massive amount of money. Hao took it gladly, using it to purchase gifts for Daciana, Nessa, and Victoria. Those items allowed the three novices to not only survive the remainder of the tournament, but also to emerge as the victors.</p> <p>Gregory and his wives fought honorably and hard to advance to the finals, where their last fight was against the Eternal Flame. With their rigorous training and communication, they managed to defeat the arrogant clan, letting them stand alongside their novice friends as champions.</p> <p>The excitement of being the champions wasn’t the happiest part of their year, though. That came after the tournament, when all five of their friends—Nessa, Daciana, Victoria, Clover, and Ling—joined Aether’s Guard.</p> <p>The apprentices weren’t done yet, as they had other major events ahead of them. The tournament for their tactics class was first and, beyond that, the tournament against Buldoun.</p>",

He left his old friends and his old life behind, and was taken to the Magi Academy to start training to serve the Vela Empire. Suddenly alone and out of place, he prepared for the worst.</p> <p>When the beautiful novice, Yukiko Warlin, asked if they could be friends, his life changed again. After six months of duplicity from the people who they had thought of as friends, Gregory and Yukiko isolated themselves from all the other novices.</p> <p>Gregory chose a path considered impossible for his training, and Yukiko followed, pushing each other to strive ever harder. When Yukiko’s betrothal was annulled, the two friends were free to express the deeper feelings that had developed between them.</p> <p>The first tournament for the novices was brutal on the two young lovers. Both of them were pushed to the absolute limit, but they endured. When they took the top two spots, their fellow novices dropped the pretense of friendship, when neither would bow to the machinations of their peers.</p> <p>Now, the rest of their first year stands before them. It’s become clear that they should join a clan, but where can they find one that would treat them both fairly and equally?</p>",

The law he is bound to allows him to slip past Eternium’s ironclad rules and break things once thought immutable. For his family, for all of their futures, he must boldly go where few in Cal like to venture: the game world of Eternia.</p> <p>Most of the people that have come to test this world hate being here: dying in days and returning home in disarray. Artorian agrees with them: A body based entirely on hard numbers and increasingly potent limiters is a stark difference from the intent-based Essence user he has always been. Eternia is no final product, riddled with more holes than a wheel of dire cheese. This wireframe of a world is seemingly held together with glue, tape, and moody pylons. He vows to dig into the construction, finding and fixing where it went wrong.</p> <p>Yet, why meander through scaffolding when one can parkour through the rafters? It’s speed-run time!</p>",

Then, on planet LV178, he and his fellow miners discovered a storm-scoured, sand-blasted hell - and trimonite, the hardest material known to man.  When a shuttle crashes into the mining ship Marion, the miners learn that there was more than trimonite deep in the caverns. There was evil, hibernating and waiting for suitable prey. Hoop and his associates uncover a nest of Xenomorphs, and hell takes on a new meaning. Quickly they discover that their only hope lies with the unlikeliest of saviors....  Ellen Ripley, the last human survivor of the salvage ship Nostromo. ",

    "description": "All Systems Red is the tense first science fiction adventure novella in Martha Wells' series The Murderbot Diaries. For fans of Westworld, Ex Machina, Ann Leckie's Imperial Raadch series, or Iain M. Banks' Culture novels.  All Systems Red tackles questions of the ethics of sentient robotics. The main character is a deadly security droid that has bucked its restrictive programming and is balanced between contemplative self-discovery and an idle instinct to kill all humans.  In a corporate-dominated spacefaring future, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company. Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety.  But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn't a primary concern.  On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied 'droid - a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as \"Murderbot.\"  Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is. But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth. ",

    "description": "The epic and highly anticipated conclusion to the listener-favorite series that had countless Audible listeners (and employees) hooked from the very first Bob - featuring, as always, a flawless performance from the inimitable Ray Porter.  Being a sentient spaceship really should be more fun. But after spreading out through space for almost a century, Bob and his clones just can't stay out of trouble.  They've created enough colonies so humanity shouldn't go extinct. But political squabbles have a bad habit of dying hard, and the Brazilian probes are still trying to take out the competition. And the Bobs have picked a fight with an older, more powerful species with a large appetite and a short temper.  Still stinging from getting their collective butts kicked in their first encounter with the Others, the Bobs now face the prospect of a decisive final battle to defend Earth and its colonies. But the Bobs are less disciplined than a herd of cats, and some of the younger copies are more concerned with their own local problems than defeating the Others.  Yet salvation may come from an unlikely source. A couple of eighth-generation Bobs have found something out in deep space. All it will take to save the Earth and perhaps all of humanity is for them to get it to Sol - unless the Others arrive first.  All These Worlds is the third installment in the blockbuster Audible Original Bobiverse series - which has sold more than one million copies.",

But Arthur has an edge: a stolen heart card that secretly fell into his possession, thanks to a dragon. It’s a priceless source of power for the Baron and the tyrant will kill to get it back. Invaluable, too, to a young man of spellcasting ambitions.</p> <p>So, at the behest of his father—and to save his own hide—Arthur flees and joins a trader caravan on the kingdom’s backroads. Mile by dusty mile, he gains new skills and learns more about his increasing capabilities. But when he meets Horatio, his sharp-tongued new best friend and a spell card collector himself, Arthur discovers the greater powers to come by building on the Legendary card hidden close to his heart.</p> <p>One step ahead of the Baron’s hunters, Arthur and Horatio forge on under a sky full of guardian dragons—from the adorably loopy to the mystically wise—and their unflappable riders. Amidst danger, rescue, and friendships with both humans and those creatures of the more leathery variety, Arthur awakens to a newfound confidence . . . and the extraordinary things that can arise from the simplest magics.</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit progression fantasy series, featuring a unique card-based magic system, now available for the first time!</b></p>",

    "description": "Until the Confederation created Allora, it had produced SADEs (self-aware digital entities) for hundreds of years with enormous consistency and harnessed their capabilities to power the society. But this particular young SADE was disturbed by her confinement. Trapped in metal-alloy housing on the bridge of a luxury passenger liner, Allora sought to possess the same freedom enjoyed by humans, who came and went from her starship with abandon.  Allora's hope for emancipation rested on Alex Racine, the Haraken president who had freed his SADEs, and she yearned to walk the worlds a free entity, as they did. Racine had pleaded for years with the Council of Leaders to give the Confederation SADEs equal status as citizens, and it was Allora's thought to have him intercede on her behalf and bargain for her transfer to a mobile avatar so that she might live among the Harakens.  But Allora's plans were thrown into disarray when she learned that Racine would soon end his presidency. Desperate, Allora, known to her fellow SADEs as the wild child, concocts a plan to kidnap the Council Leader and his associates. She intends to hold them hostage until they acquiesce to her demands.  Little does Allora know that her actions will set the Confederation and the Harakens on a collision course. Quietly waiting and watching the drama unfold are tens of thousands of SADEs, who control Confederation starships, stations, and Houses and have a vested interest in the outcome. ",

    "description": "<p><b>A young man unwillingly saddled with a Werewolf System attempts to live his life . . . without killing too many people . . .</b></p> <p>Not long ago, Gary was just another punk teenager living in a ramshackle house in a ramshackle town. To survive, he worked as a gofer for a brutal street gang—until a simple job went bad, and he ended up paired with a Werewolf System that enhanced his strength, stamina, <i>and</i> attitude.</p> <p>But as Gary quickly learned, this gift could also be a curse, costing anyone who got too close to him their life. Now, he's trying to figure out how to use his system to make things better for those around him. Unfortunately, before things get better, they're going to get much, much worse.</p> <p>Because Gary isn't the only werewolf roaming the streets. And he's not necessarily the strongest. Plus, his rivals belong to gangs that would be more than happy to put him down like a mad dog. His only hope is to level up, man up, and let his killer instinct take over.</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit progression-fantasy series—with more than five million views on Webnovel—now available on Audible and wherever ebooks are sold!</b></p>",

    "description": "An academy that scrapes the sky. Blight that fills the earth. Two codgers duking it out. Artorian has decided to live, all in order to save his lost village children. His recent battle against a simple raider captain has proven that if he tries to charge ahead...he'll die. With the help of his captors, who quickly turn into close friends, Artorian takes the first steps onto the path of a true cultivator. Finesse, skill, fine-tuned cultivation techniques, and more is within his grasp. Artorian is more than willing to learn; after all, that's his specialty! This knowledge has strings attached. After meeting the ancient enemy of his trainers, Artorian returns to the place he first studied his true passion of philosophy: the Skyspear. It's under new management, and the alumni have very different ideas about how the students should be trained.",

Not only does he get to chase around people with world-shattering abilities and force them into hibernation, he gets to break up his days by living through the worst portions of his life all over again. Nothing like trauma to fuel personal growth!</p> <p>Nasty creatures Artorian thought were gone forever have begun appearing in the dark corners of the world, smiling at him with too many teeth.

Exactly how he likes it.</p>",

    "description": "George Orwell's classic satire of the Russian Revolution is an intimate part of our contemporary culture, quoted so often that we tend to forget who wrote the original words. It is an account of the bold struggle that transforms Mr. Jones' Manor Farm into Animal Farm, a wholly democratic society built on the credo that All Animals Are Created Equal. Out of their cleverness, the pigs Napoleon, Squealer, and Snowball emerge as leaders of the new community in a subtle evolution that bears an insidious familiarity. The climax is the brutal betrayal of the faithful horse Boxer, when totalitarian rule is re-established with the bloodstained postscript to the founding slogan: But Some Animals Are More Equal Than Others.",

Still, Darth Karrid, commander of the fearsome Imperial battle cruiser <i>Ascendant Spear,</i> continues her relentless efforts to achieve total Sith domination of the galaxy. </p> <p>But Karrid’s ruthless determination is more than matched in the steely resolve of Theron Shan, whose unfinished business with the Empire could change the course of the war for good. Though the son of a Jedi master, Theron does not wield the Force - but like his renowned mother, the spirit of rebellion is in his blood. As a top covert agent for the Republic, he struck a crucial blow against the Empire by exposing and destroying a Sith superweapon arsenal - which makes him the ideal operative for a daring and dangerous mission to end Ascendant Spear’s reign of terror. </p> <p>Joined by hot-headed smuggler Teff’ith, with whom he has an inexplicable bond, and wise Jedi warrior Gnost-Dural, Darth Karrid’s former master, Theron must match wits and weapons with a battle-tested crew of the most cold-blooded dark-side disciples. But time is brutally short. And if they don’t seize their one chance to succeed, they will surely have countless opportunities to die.</p>",

The company he’d badgered for a job eventually hired him, earning him the nickname “Badger.” While most people dropped out of the lifestyle after a few years, Zander had found a place that felt right to him.</p> <p>A decade in, he’d even found a couple of friends who stayed on with him. One was Devin Smith, the heavy weapons specialist for the squad and a proud Texan. Another was Selda Engel, their tech specialist. She’d slowly transitioned from a friend to a friend-with-benefits, but even that had started to become more.</p> <p>On rotation again, Zander made a vow to ask Selda to recognize their relationship as more than just a casual hookup, planning to do so as soon as they were back off schedule. The universe, however, was about to remind him of a crucial lesson and old adage: “Life is what happens when you’re busy making plans.” Sent out into the desert on what looked like a wild goose chase, they were about to head back when everything changed.</p> <p>Shifted by quantum entanglement from Earth to an alien planet, Zander and his squad would have to adapt—and quickly—if they wanted to live. As they tried to understand what was happening, the stark truth of their new reality thrust itself on the shaken humans. Giant machines of war were attacking an equally humongous bug.</p> <p>And, quite unfortunately, the giant bug had a lot of little friends. The ensuing firefight ended with Zander left as the sole human survivor. Out of his dimension and wounded, he had to face an entirely new universe, and the Antecedents' Legacy would soon become the primary focus of his life.</p>",

    "description": "The human race started the sixth mass extinction on Earth.  A chain of subglacial volcanoes erupt in Iceland. The melting ice floods the countryside. Poisonous gas descends on Scotland. A tsunami devastates the Norwegian coastline. An ash cloud rises into the atmosphere, blotting out the sun across Europe, ushering in a new Ice Age. Dozens of nuclear power plants, flooded by ocean water, experience meltdowns. Millions perish. Many more are displaced. All on the first day.  On the second day, a series of earthquakes moving in a straight line, reveal the presence of something massive walking across the landscape. Concealed by a thick, radioactive ash cloud, the 'aberration' heads west, toward Russia.  Abraham Wright, a science writer for Modern Scientist, who wants nothing more than to be reunited with his family, finds himself at the center of the United States' response to the crisis. Under his new title as Assistant Science Advisor to the President, Wright is sent to Europe with a team of Army Rangers, where he uncovers the truth about the ancient behemoth laying waste to the world: there have been five mass extinctions on planet Earth, and the aberration has been present at each.  On the third day, the world fights back.  And loses.  Separated from his family by continents and oceans ravaged by countless disasters and populated by strange new life, Wright struggles to survive in an evolving world. Hoping to uncover the key to mankind's redemption, he fights for answers, and to reach his loved ones - before the human race's extinction.  The Apocalypse Machine will finish it.  Jeremy Robinson returns to the Kaiju thriller genre he popularized with the largest Kaiju to ever appear in fiction: the Apocalypse Machine. Bursting with all the epic action, desperate struggle and complex characters that listeners have come to expect, Robinson takes the world to the brink. ",

Jeb just wants to defuse himself before he collapses into a sickly pile of green goo or ignites in a city-destroying blast. There's just one problem: The world doesn't slow down because you've got a nuclear hangnail. Mab, Queen of the Fae wants him for unknown, yet most likely sinister reasons.

My master created me for his entertainment, leading adventurers to ruin. Betraying them at the last moment, just when their glorious victory was on hand. I have been found again by the newest member of a quartet of dungeon crawlers. Poor fool. This time will be no different. Or does it have to be?  Maybe I don't need to spend eternity left in a deep, dark dungeon waiting to devour would-be heroes. Maybe, just maybe, I can take him over and use this new identity to leave and masquerade as an adventurer myself. Betray my master—my purpose—and grow strong enough to find a new one. One problem. Hopefully, my new companions won't realize I'm not who, or what, they think I am. Don't miss this progression fantasy epic from debut author C.B. Titus, about a cursed suit of mimic-armor and an unsuspecting hero. Perfect for fans of Dungeons and Dragons, The Murderbot Diaries, Goblin Slayer, and lovers of all things progression fantasy/GameLit. ",

However, the powers in the world are moving and there is no time to rest. Even if Artorian doesn’t realize his part in it, the next stage of the great plan is set in motion.  In a place of mountains and dales, the old scholar must seek new information in order to puzzle out the last pieces and gather victory with his own two hands. For his loved ones, his humanity may need to be left behind. Yet, becoming something else is a small price to pay for an old man on a mission. Life comes at a price, but success comes with Ascension.  War and Moonfall loom on the horizon. It matters little. Artorian will build his arsenal.",

    "description": "<p>The best-selling author of <i>The Martian</i> returns with an irresistible new near-future thriller - a heist story set on the moon. </p> <p>Jazz Bashara is a criminal. Well, sort of. Life on Artemis, the first and only city on the moon, is tough if you're not a rich tourist or an eccentric billionaire. So smuggling in the occasional harmless bit of contraband barely counts, right? Not when you've got debts to pay and your job as a porter barely covers the rent. </p> <p>Everything changes when Jazz sees the chance to commit the perfect crime, with a reward too lucrative to turn down. But pulling off the impossible is just the start of her problems, as she learns that she's stepped square into a conspiracy for control of Artemis itself - and that now her only chance at survival lies in a gambit even riskier than the first. </p> <p>Bringing to life Weir's brash, whip-smart protagonist is actress Rosario Dawson (Marvel's <i>The Defenders</i>, <i>Sin City</i>, <i>Death Proof</i>). With the breathless immediacy of one realizing they're one cracked helmet visor away from oblivion, Dawson deftly captures Jazz's first-person perspective – all while delivering sarcastic Weir-ian one-liners and cracking wise in the face of death. And with a cast of diverse characters from all walks of life calling Artemis home, Dawson tonally somersaults to voice Kenyan prime ministers, Ukrainian scientists, and Saudi welders. It's a performance that transports listeners right alongside Jazz, matching her step for step on every lunar inch of her pulse-pounding journey. </p>",

    "description": "<p><b>In an isolated Alaskan town, the local sheriff uncovers a secret lab where generative AI and bioprinting have unleashed something monstrous....</b></p> <p>Sheriff Colton Graves prefers the quiet life in Raven's Rest, Alaska, a remote town accessible only by tunnel and home to a hardy mix of locals and secrets buried in the ice. But when a camel wanders down Main Street—its head grotesquely sprouting a dozen eyes—Colton knows his quiet days are over. The bizarre incident leads him to NovaGen, a nearby research facility constructed inside a Cold War bunker, buried in the mountains above town. There, a trail of blood and eerie silence hints at something far more sinister than an escaped animal experiment.</p> <p>With his deputies—the sharp-witted Tali and rookie Ethan—Colton recruits a few trusted locals, including the unshakable Marit, Tali's sister; the intimidating \"Grizz\" Norval; and Edgar \"Old Red\" Rydell, an aging man plagued by demons from when he worked at the bunker during its covert days.</p> <p>Together, they investigate the abandoned lab. What begins as a search for missing scientists soon reveals chilling evidence: pools of blood without bodies, cryptic warnings left behind, a bloody six-fingered handprint, and the revelation of a generative AI capable of printing living organisms. As they descend deeper into the lab, it becomes clear the answers they seek may come at a terrifying cost—and what was made in the dark may not be content to stay there.</p> <p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> and #1 Audible bestselling author, Jeremy Robinson reclaims his title as one of the best Michael Crichton successors with this harrowing blend of suspense, science, and survival. </b><b><i>Artifact</i></b><b> takes listeners into a frozen abyss where innovation and nightmares collide.</b></p>",

    "description": "The great spheres and probes of Artifice, humankind's enemy, haunt every inhabited world near and far. The Omnians' long and arduous search for Artifice has ended. They've located Artifice's lair in the Talus system. The sentient digital entity rules a vast swath of worlds, known as the federacy, through ruthless intimidation. Its insidious programs are embedded in every races' digital systems - warships, shuttles, stations, domes, comm platforms, and power plants. One misstep by a race could see its citizens exterminated in vast numbers. The survivors, if there were any, would be thrown back to the days before spaceflight. Artifice has had millennia to secure its base. Powerful battleship fleets guard the system's periphery and the approaches above and below the entity's planet, Toral. Probes surround the system and warn of unauthorized encroachment, and Artifice has control of the planet's army of bots. The Omnian expeditionary fleet, led by Alex Racine, desperately needs allies in order to defeat or circumvent Artifice's defensive measures. The Omnians are curious about the fleet of black-hulled battleships, which bear a resemblance to Artifice's probes and guard the Talus system. The SADEs, the Omnians' digital friends, believe that the sentients aboard the black fleet and Artifice share a common history. Whether or not the Omnians can gather allies, they don't intend to abandon their goal and return to Omnia. They mean to capture or destroy the entity, Artifice, or die trying.",

It appeals to fans of Westworld, Ex Machina, Ann Leckie's Imperial Raadch series, or Iain M. Banks' Culture novels. The main character is a deadly security droid that has bucked its restrictive programming and is balanced between contemplative self-discovery and an idle instinct to kill all humans. \"As a heartless killing machine, I was a complete failure.\" It has a dark past - one in which a number of humans were killed. A past that caused it to christen itself \"Murderbot.\" But it has only vague memories of the massacre that spawned that title, and it wants to know more. Teaming up with a Research Transport vessel named ART (you don't want to know what the \"A\" stands for), Murderbot heads to the mining facility where it went rogue. What it discovers will forever change the way it thinks.",

    "description": "<p>The Wizard's Council of Tarador was supposed to tell young Koren Bladewell that he is a wizard. They were supposed to tell everyone that he is not a jinx, that all the bad things that happen around him are because he can't control the power inside him, power he doesn't know about. The people of his village, even his parents, are afraid of him, afraid he is cursed. That he is a dangerous, evil jinx. The Wizard's Council didn't tell young Koren, because they know what is best for him. Even after their silent deception destroys his life. </p> <p>Crown Princess Ariana Trehayme will become queen of Tarador on her 16th birthday, if her weak, indecisive mother the Regent hasn't allowed their ancient enemy to conquer Tarador before then. Ariana wants her royal army to strike at the enemy, but her mother knows what is best for her, and the realm.Together, Ariana and Koren can save Tarador, if the adults, who know best, will get out of their way. </p>",

The stakes are high and the pressure is on, for an Imperial war effort hinges on them executing their duty before disaster strikes.</p> <p>The story:</p> <p>The Officio Assassinorum safeguards the future of humanity. Its agents are the bloody-handed, secret saviours of the Imperium, killers charged with achieving the impossible...and Vindicare assassin Absolom Raithe has just been handed the most difficult assignment of his career.</p> <p>The Knight World of Dominion is on the verge of seceding from the Imperium, its court riven by factionalism and ruled by an increasingly unhinged monarch. With the aid of the shapeshifting Callidus assassin Sycorax, Raithe must remove the king from his throne—and safely steer a pro-Imperial candidate to victory through the brutal succession crisis that will inevitably ensue. His team will need to infiltrate a world steeped in chivalric codes, where every move risks discovery and every threat pilots an adamantine monster...for if the assassins fail, and Dominion falls, the entire sector will be plunged into darkness.</p> <p>Written by Robert Rath. Narrated by Gareth Armstrong. Running time 11 hours 12 minutes.</p>",

    "description": "The aliens came. We won, but billions died. Now, it's time to rebuild.   The neons do as they're told. Chemically bound to their masters by the experimental chemi-chip implant created from alien technology, they are genetically engineered at rapid rates to be servants for the survivors of the war against alien invaders. Without neons, reconstruction would be impossible.  Colin Hanston - the unremarkable son of the genius who invented the chemi-chip - leads a simple life as a farmer, helping feed his district as any good citizen should. But when he redeems his voucher for a neon servant of his own named Michael, everything changes. His father’s old friend-turned-rebel shows up, and Colin learns that not everyone believes the neons are a simple commodity used by the Authority to fix the world and help prepare in case the aliens return.  Knowing he could be killed just for talking to the rebels, Colin will have to decide for himself whether his father’s work is truly a benefit to humanity as his leaders claim, or a perversion.  Is the truth worth destroying his father’s legacy and putting his family in danger? Is it worth dying for?  Don't miss this dystopian sci-fi thriller, perfect for fans of Hugh Howey, Jasper T Scott, and Paul Antony Jones. ",

    "description": "A town put to the sword. The young forcibly recruited. An old man out for revenge. After his town is put to the sword and the children are taken to replace the fallen, an old man is out for revenge. He’s ready to fail at the most difficult challenge in the world: cultivation. Too corrupted to even take the first steps, the sly old elder simply agreed with those who told him that it was impossible. Then, he quietly ignored them, rubbed his hands together, and started anyway. He had always failed in what he did: He lost his way from the academy, his command was devastated by a mage, he lost his town, and now his last hopes for the future had been stolen by a group of raiders. The only thing that had never failed him was his sharp mind and philosophy. He would cultivate...no matter what it cost him. A lifetime of failure can dull and dampen a soul. A reason to live, a goal, can change that in an instant. It is always darkest just before the dawn.",

    "description": "<p>After her near-fatal journey into the Descent, Ilea returns south to check on her allies and lay some groundwork for unlocking her elusive third Class.<br /> <br /> Trian is ready to start training the first generation of Medic Sentinels, the battle-healers of their newly founded organization, and Ilea is happy to join in as a teacher (of sorts). Hopefully, her work will pay off in the birth of at least a few mini-versions of herself.<br /> <br /> By day, Ilea teaches the Sentinels her way of fighting and training (resistances), and by night, she applies the principles to herself. She explores supposedly very dangerous dungeons in the south and exposes herself to all manner of magics and traps, as every increased skill and resistance will help prepare her for the coming of her third class.<br /> <br /> It is a good routine; as long as she has mana to heal, the numbers will go up.<br /> <br /> However, all good grinding sessions must come to an end, the invitation of a powerful order soon pulls her back into the conflicts of humanity and beyond. With new powers and allies, she flies into a kingdom on the losing side of a war and finds things are not quite as they seem...<br /> <br /> Perhaps punching a lot of things really hard will once again prove to be a viable solution.</p> <p>--</p> <p><b>About the series:</b><br /> <br /> Join Ilea as she is transported to a world full of monsters and magic, where power is measured by one's class, level and skills. Watch her grow in power, and recklessness, as she wields ancient hand-to-hand combat magic that can both heal and destroy. This Isekai story has a dual-Class LitRPG system where every skill, class and ability can evolve. Ilea’s tale is equal parts comfy slice-of-life wanderings, goofy jokes and brutal, blood-pumping battles with nightmarish monsters. Join her as she delves into forgotten dungeons, hoards snacks and generally does whatever she feels like.</p>",

It will end in blood.&nbsp;</p><p>The Free Navy - a violent group of Belters in black-market military ships - has crippled the Earth and begun a campaign of piracy and violence among the outer planets.&nbsp;</p><p>The colony ships heading for the 1,000 new worlds on the far side of the alien ring gates are easy prey, and no single navy remains strong enough to protect them. James Holden and his crew know the strengths and weaknesses of this new force better than anyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Outnumbered and outgunned, the embattled remnants of the old political powers call on the <em>Rocinante</em> for a desperate mission to reach Medina Station at the heart of the gate network. But the new alliances are as flawed as the old, and the struggle for power has only just begun.&nbsp;</p><p>As the chaos grows, an alien mystery deepens. Pirate fleets, mutiny and betrayal may be the least of the <em>Rocinante</em>'s problems. And in the uncanny spaces past the ring gates, the choices of a few damaged and desperate people may determine the fate of more than just humanity.&nbsp;</p>",

In fact, at this point merely crashing the multi-billion-dollar ship he had helped design would have felt like winning the lottery compared to his current dilemma. If only he were so lucky. Things had started off all right - that is, until a freak wormhole unexpectedly swallowed his ship, leaving him stranded on an unknown planet far, far from home.   </p> <p>With the crew’s lives at stake, Charlie had no choice but to stop his whining, put on his big boy pants, and step up to save them all, and much to his surprise, it actually looked like he might succeed. Of course, that was when things really went sideways in ways that made merely crashing on an uncharted planet seem like a walk in the park.  </p> <p>Suddenly, faced with alien space pirates, talking dragons, and something that seemed very much like magic, Charlie found himself adrift, feeling like a space age Robinson Crusoe - only his man Friday was a blue-skinned alien, and this wasn't just a desert island. It was a whole new galaxy.</p>",

His search takes him to stormy mountaintops, an experimental military weapons lab, and an old Soviet science station. </p> <p>The more he learns, the more he comes to realize that ball lightning is just the tip of an entirely new frontier in particle physics. Although Chen’s quest provides a purpose for his lonely life, his reasons for chasing his elusive quarry come into conflict with soldiers and scientists who have motives of their own: a beautiful army major with an obsession with dangerous weaponry, and a physicist who has no place for ethical considerations in his single-minded pursuit of knowledge. </p> <p><i>Ball Lightning</i>, by award-winning Chinese science fiction author Cixin Liu, is a fast-paced audiobook about what happens when the beauty of scientific inquiry runs up against a push to harness new discoveries with no consideration of their possible consequences. </p> <p>This program is read by Feodor Chin, voice of Zenyatta in <i>Overwatch</i>. </p>",

I mean, last year was pretty hectic.

Oh! And I got married. Pretty neat, huh? Well, this year, after the Spring Planting season, I’m really gonna relax and put down roots. It’s the slow life for me. Sure, the talking animals and cultivators coming to live with me are a bit weird, but this year everything is gonna be basically normal. There definitely won’t be any Heavenly Tribulations, ancient formations, or cultivator issues to deal with . . .

Instead, he’s going to get a different kind of trip: a three-month stint in the ultimate immersive gaming experience. As a lifelong geek, gamer, and outsider, it’s a better gift then he’d ever dreamed.</p> <p>But when he jumps feetfirst into the world of Eternium, run by CAL (the Certified Altruistic Lexicon), it’s not exactly what he expected. All he wants is to quest, game, grind some levels, and get his hands on awesome loot. You know, have fun! But the Mage’s College seems to have a very different definition of fun - one involving study, blisteringly strict regulations, aristocratic hierarchy, and tons of pay to play.</p> <p>Sam crosses the college and finds himself running for his life with a back-talking book that is far more than it seems and a class that no one has even heard of. If he can navigate the deadly college politics and the looming war with the barbaric Wolfmen, he might just find the fun and adventure he was looking for.</p>",

    "description": "It was the end of World War II. FDR's New Deal had redefined American politics. Taxes were at an all-time high. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had created a fear of total annihilation. The rise of secret government agencies and sanctions on business had many watching their backs. America's sense of freedom was diminishing... and many were desperate to take that freedom back.  Among them was a great dreamer, an immigrant who'd pulled himself from the depths of poverty to become one of the wealthiest and most admired men in the world. That man was Andrew Ryan, and he believed that great men and women deserved better. So he set out to create the impossible: a utopia free from government, from censorship, and from moral restrictions on science, where what you gave was what you got. He created Rapture - the shining city below the sea. But this utopia suffered a great tragedy. This is the story of how it all came to be... and how it all ended.",

    "description": "Something is buried underneath Liscor. And it's hungry. Of course, if there were only one thing under Liscor, there would be far less to fear. However, the dungeon continues to be a threat. At the same time, Goblins continue to roam northern Izril, but not all of them are as hostile to people as Tremborag or the Goblin Lord. Will the Unseen Emperor of Riverfarm make that distinction, however? A reckoning is coming as old faces and new reemerge. And all the while, The Wandering Inn is still serving food and respite and even plays to adventurers and Antinium alike. But something is coming from the dungeons. And it—they—are hungry.",

    "description": "For its initial mission, Haraken's explorer ship, the Sojourn, undertook the investigation of Celus-5, a world identified by Willem, a SADE (self-aware digital entity), and his team of scientists, as the best candidate for a new colony.  What should have been a routine survey mission became a disaster. To the Harakens' surprise, they discovered not one but two alien species, which were constantly engaged in conflict. One species, the Dischnya, hid their nests underground, and each nest owed its allegiance to a queen. On the grassy plains, where the Dischnya lived, the resources were scarce, and the warriors competed fiercely.  Unfortunately, the Harakens' landing party was late in discovering the Dischnya's hideouts, and a shuttle and crew, including Teague, Alex Racine's son, were captured by the doglike warriors of the Tawas Soma nest. Soon the mission was mired in a standoff, and Captain Asu Azasdau fired off a comm to Haraken, pleading for a rescue from Tomas Monti, the Haraken president, and Alex Racine.  The survey group might have been forgiven for their hasty landing. They were focused on investigating the three objects buried in the sands along the continent's shoreline. Smooth, dark, and silver, they were the ships belonging to the nemesis of every human - the Nua'll.  The dark travelers presented another clue as to the direction of the Nua'll home world, but it also invoked the question: Where were the Swei Swee, the six-legged, whistling aliens who once were aboard the ships?

    "description": "I don't publicly advertise that I'm a mage, but I don't exactly hide it either, and one of the odd things I've learnt over the years is just how much you can get away with if you're blatant enough. Hide something behind smoke and mirrors and make people work to find it, and they'll tear the place down looking for what's there. Alex Verus is a diviner who can see probable futures-a talent that's gotten him out of many a tough scrape. But this time, he may be in over his head. Alex was once apprenticed to a Dark mage, and in his service he did a lot of things he isn't proud of. As rumors swirl that his old master is coming back, Alex comes face to face with his misdeeds in the form of a young adept whose only goal is to get revenge. Alex has changed his life for the better, but he's afraid of what his friends - including his apprentice, Luna - will think of his past. But if they're going to put themselves at risk, they need to know exactly what kind of man they're fighting for...",

    "description": "Hugo Award Winner for Best Series The fourth book in the NYT best-selling Expanse series, Cibola Burn sees the crew of the Rocinante on a new frontier, as the rush to colonize the new planets threatens to outrun law and order and give way to war and chaos. Now a Prime Original series. Enter a new frontier. \"An empty apartment, a missing family, that's creepy. But this is like finding a military base with no one on it. Fighters and tanks idling on the runway with no drivers. This is bad juju. Something wrong happened here. What you should do is tell everyone to leave\". The gates have opened the way to a thousand new worlds and the rush to colonize has begun. Settlers looking for a new life stream out from humanity's home planets. Ilus, the first human colony on this vast new frontier, is being born in blood and fire. Independent settlers stand against the overwhelming power of a corporate colony ship with only their determination, courage, and the skills learned in the long wars of home. Innocent scientists are slaughtered as they try to survey a new and alien world. The struggle on Ilus threatens to spread all the way back to Earth. James Holden and the crew of his one small ship are sent to make peace in the midst of war and sense in the midst of chaos. But the more he looks at it, the more Holden thinks the mission was meant to fail. And the whispers of a dead man remind him that the great galactic civilization that once stood on this land is gone. And that something killed it.

After being murdered by a mystery assailant, navigating his way through the realm between life and death, and being brought back to the mortal world, Harry realizes that maybe death wasn’t all that bad - because he is no longer Harry Dresden, Chicago’s only professional wizard. He is now Harry Dresden, Winter Knight to Mab, the Queen of Air and Darkness.  After Harry had no choice but to swear his fealty, Mab wasn’t about to let something as petty as death steal away the prize she had sought for so long. And now, her word is his command, no matter what she wants him to do, no matter where she wants him to go, and no matter who she wants him to kill. Guess which one Mab wants first?  Of course, it won’t be an ordinary, everyday assassination. Mab wants her newest minion to pull off the impossible: kill an immortal. No problem there, right? And to make matters worse, there exists a growing threat to an unfathomable source of magic that could land Harry in the sort of trouble that will make death look like a holiday.  Beset by enemies new and old, Harry must gather his friends and allies, prevent the annihilation of countless innocents, and find a way out of his eternal subservience before his newfound powers claim the only thing he has left to call his own… his soul.",

Now he’s a disgraced recluse, hoping to live out the rest of his life on a backwater planet where no one cares about his “crimes” and everyone leaves him alone.</p> <p>It’s never that easy.</p> <p>A CEO’s daughter has gone missing and he thinks Butler is the only one who can find her. The government is only too happy to appease him. Butler isn’t so sure, but he knows the pain of losing a daughter, so he reluctantly signs on. Soon he’s on a military ship heading for a newly formed colony where the dangerous jungle lurks just outside the domes where settlers live.</p> <p>Paired with Mac, Ganos, and a government-assigned aide named Fader, Butler dives head-first into what should be an open and shut case. Then someone tries to blow him up. Faced with an incompetent local governor, a hamstrung military, and corporations playing fast and loose with the laws, Butler finds himself in familiar territory. He’s got nobody to trust but himself, but that’s where he works best. He’ll fight to get to the bottom of the mystery, but this time, he might not live to solve it.</p>",

There we were, innocently drifting along the cosmos on our little blue marble, like the native Americans in 1492. Over the horizon come ships of a technologically advanced, aggressive culture, and BAM! There go the good old days, when humans only got killed by each other. So, Columbus Day. It fits. When the morning sky twinkled again, this time with Kristang starships jumping in to hammer the Ruhar, we thought we were saved. The UN Expeditionary Force hitched a ride on Kristang ships to fight the Ruhar, wherever our new allies thought we could be useful. So, I went from fighting with the US Army in Nigeria, to fighting in space. It was lies, all of it. We shouldn't even be fighting the Ruhar, they aren't our enemy. Our allies are. I'd better start at the beginning.",

With good fortune, Alex will bring together the diverse races the Omnians have encountered. Alex selects the human colonies of New Terra, Haraken, Omnia, and Méridien to solicit their attendance. Unknowingly, he sails toward a deadly encounter. The Omnians have their supporters, but they also have their detractors. Nowhere is that truer than on Méridien. Alex, Renée de Guirnon, his partner, and Julien, the SADE leader, have continually disrupted the long-held norms of the powerful Confederation Houses. In one instance, Alex wins the rights for SADEs to be freed from their boxes. In another, he presses the Confederation Council to construct ships and supply crews to support Omnia Ships’ fights against the dangerous Nua’ll spheres and Artifice. However, Alex’s influence is most heavily felt when Mahima Ganesh, the tyrannical Council Leader, is deposed. Her supporters never forgive Alex for his trespass, and one House Leader decides Alex must pay for that insult. Leader Darse Lemoyne is a clever man, who hopes to deal with Alex. Also, he desperately wants to be rid of an ambitious daughter. Daphne Lemoyne covets the House, while she pretends to be a doting daughter. If Darse succeeds in this plot, he rids himself of one problem or the other. If fortune stands by him, he will be done with both.",

    "description": "Exploding from the pages of Horror, Humor, and Heroes, Volume One - it’s the full length adventures of the one and only Mechani-Cal! So grab your battlesuit and prepare to get a little nasty.  \"Being a supervillain means never having to say you’re sorry - unless it’s to the judge or the parole board. Even then, you don’t really have to. It’s not like it’s going to change the outcome or anything.\" Those are the words of Calvin Matthew Stringel, better known as Mechani-Cal. He’s a down-on-his-luck armored villain. Follow his exploits as he gets swept up in a world domination scheme gone wrong and ends up working for these weak willed, mercy loving heroes. Immerse yourself in epic battles and see what it’s like to be an outsider looking in at a world that few have ever experienced. Climb into Cal’s battlesuit and join him on his journey. Will he avoid selling out his principles for a paycheck and a pardon? Can he resist the camaraderie of being on a super team? Does he fall prey to the ample charms of the beautiful Olympian Aphrodite? How will he survive the jealous schemes of Ultraweapon, who wears armor so powerful it makes Cal’s look like a museum piece?  See the world of “righteous do-gooders” through the eyes of someone who doesn’t particularly care for them. Revel in his sarcasm and hang on for one wild ride! Just remember: losing an argument with a group of rioters isn’t a good excuse to start lobbing tear gas indiscriminately at them. You’ve only got so many rounds and it’s going to be a long day, so make sure you get as many as possible with each one.",

I never use my real name; it’s too dangerous, for me and for anyone I meet.</p> <p>I’m on the run from the law, who think I killed my aunt, and from whoever did kill her, because they want to finish the job. So, I move around a lot, working construction or whatever job I can find. It’s a lonely life. I don’t let anyone get close...people who get close to me end up dead. Why?</p> <p>I’m a wizard. The world’s only wizard, as far as I know. I don’t have a wand or a sword, and I don’t ride a dragon. I carry a Glock, and drive around in a beat-up RV with a talking dog.</p> <p>Yeah. The talking dog was a surprise to me, too. Duke is inhabited by the spirit of a 3,000-year-old wizard from Babylon, and he’s a good dog, but he is still a dog, and that’s a problem. Like, he still thinks squirrels are his mortal enemy. And that I don’t feed him enough. How did the spirit of a wizard reach across millennia, to our time? I don’t know.</p> <p>The truth is, I’m not much of a wizard, because there’s not much magic in the world for me to work with. But there <i>used</i> to be magic. And magic is coming back as our world converges with the Nether.</p> <p>Unless I can stop it.</p>",

While at the same time, they also strive to determine what is their ultimate goal against the Heliothropes, which will determine the future of their endeavors.</p> <p>Even with their combined might, will it be enough to stop the tyrannical reign of the Heliothropes? Only time will tell, of course, but after constructing a lasting relationship with a brand-new ally, Milton can only hope for the best.</p> <p><i>Dimensional Dungeon Cores is a continuation of the Station Cores and Dungeon Crafting series, though it can be enjoyed without having read the previous books.

    "description": "A journey that was a lifetime in the making.... Milton Frederick never had the chance to live out his life as a professional gamer on Earth, mainly because he was abducted by aliens. Unfortunately, he wasn’t returned home after the typical probing associated with such things to tell an unbelievable story to his friends. Instead, he was summarily killed and his consciousness was inserted into a Station Core, a giant, metal, egg-shaped object that could use technology to create traps, Combat Units, and other defenses to protect not just himself, but those he cared about.   Despite killing him and sticking his mind in what was essentially a giant computer, the aliens that went by the name “The Collective” weren’t actually a bad group of people. Ultimately, what they had done to Milton had been to save themselves from the incessant attacks of a different group of aliens called Heliothropes. Sadly, he never made it to where he was supposed to end up. Rather, his Station Core ended up crash-landing on a foreign planet named Proctus, as far from The Collective as it was possible to get.  However, through many difficult scenarios and by adapting to his new form, Milton was eventually able to leave Proctus with some new friends and new ships he had built with the help of his versatile drones. Now bound for Collective space to fulfill a promise to his personal AI guide, ALANNA, Milton and his crew use their trans-dimensional drive to journey there through a strange dimension that cuts down on their travel time.  What they find waiting for them when they emerge is not what any of them were expecting. Dimensional Dungeon Cores is a continuation of the Station Cores series, though it can be enjoyed without having listened to the previous books. This story contains LitRPG and GameLit mechanics, Dungeon Core elements (including dungeon construction and defense), and optional stat tables in the form of footnotes. Contains no foul language and no harems or sexual content. PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio. ",

When the idyllic planet Nebo is scorched into oblivion, it’s obvious that the Nyctus are moving massive fleets into human space again, and their intention is clear: Even if they lose their ships, they will render planets into ash. To add to the damage, they seem to have key intelligence that could only have been obtained by a human crew. Only one ship has ever gone missing, its disappearance unexplained and its crew never to be found: The Pool of Stars, one of the first starships. And she’s been missing for centuries. Now, after all these years, it’s up to Thorn to find it, for her disappearance might hold the key to victory.",

    "description": "From the number one New York Times best-selling author of the Reckoners series, the Mistborn trilogy, and the Stormlight Archive comes the third book in an epic series about a girl who will travel beyond the stars to save the world she loves from destruction. Spensa’s life as a Defiant Defense Force pilot has been far from ordinary. She proved herself one of the best starfighters in the human enclave of Detritus, and she saved her people from extermination at the hands of the Krell - the enigmatic alien species that has been holding them captive for decades. What’s more, she traveled light-years from home as an undercover spy to infiltrate the Superiority, where she learned of the galaxy beyond her small, desolate planet home. Now, the Superiority - the governing galactic alliance bent on dominating all human life - has started a galaxy-wide war. And Spensa’s seen the weapons they plan to use to end it: the Delvers. Ancient, mysterious alien forces that can wipe out entire planetary systems in an instant. Spensa knows that no matter how many pilots the DDF has, there is no defeating this predator. Except that Spensa is Cytonic. She faced down a Delver and saw something eerily familiar about it. And maybe, if she’s able to figure out what she is, she could be more than just another pilot in this unfolding war. She could save the galaxy. The only way she can discover what she really is, though, is to leave behind all she knows and enter the Nowhere. A place from which few ever return. To have courage means facing fear. And this mission is terrifying.",

But the galaxy has had other plans. He has been roped into searching for a politician’s missing son and an industry magnate’s missing daughter. He has been kidnapped, violated numerous laws, and caused the destruction of colonial facilities. He’s famous—or infamous, depending on who you ask—praised and reviled in equal measure across the galaxy for his exploits.</p> <p>And he is determined to never let the government drag him into another investigation.</p> <p>But when a runaway twelve-year-old girl whose father has gone missing asks him for help, well…it’s a lot harder to say no.</p> <p>The girl’s father, Jorge Ramiro, was supposed to have been on Taug, a moon orbiting the gas giant Ridia 5, working on a dig with a famous archaeologist. But now there’s no sign of him and no record of him being there. Mining operations on the moon are run by two different consortiums, Caliber and Omicron—both of which have tried to kill Butler in the past. Butler doesn’t believe in coincidence.</p> <p>Landing on Taug with his right-hand man Mac, computer genius Ganos, and an elite security squad, Butler soon finds that they’ve charged back into the crosshairs—because Ramiro is not the only who has disappeared, and the perpetual darkside of this moon is hiding more than the truth about a missing archaeologist…</p>",

But when he arrives to take out a particular scumbag, he only finds the man's corpse. And he's missing a shoe. </p> <p>As the investigation begins, Jack surmises he has either stumbled into a conspiracy or there's a serial killer on the loose. The team must mobilize to figure out exactly what is going on. Corruption, kidnapping, and life as they know it all collide as the group comes up against deadly elements within the very organizations they were sworn to protect. With their own lives in the balance, and the integrity of the Union government at stake, it’s a race against the clock to figure out who the players are and how to bring them down. All without being taken out themselves. </p> <p><i>Deadland Protector</i>, book four </p> <p>With the Hand dead and the Ring mostly dismantled, Burner's team turn their attention to loose ends. The thing about loose ends is if you tug at them there is always a chance that you'll pull something else loose. And sometimes that thing is much bigger than anything you are equipped to deal with. </p> <p>Against a background of clandestine operations it soon becomes apparent that the Hand's operation is being supported by someone within the government and a second powerful person within the Union. Tracking the scent of corruption, the team discover that the key players already know who they are and are coming for them. It's a case of strike or be taken out. But taking out high ranking officials is generally frowned on in Union space. Their actions will come at a cost: Burner and his team will become fugitives...if they escape with their lives. Either way, their life on Dobulla is essentially over.</p>",

    "description": "Something unholy is hunting the streets of Burlington, Vermont, stalking the campus of the local university. Chris Gordon and his contingent of demon hunters is drawn to the northern Vermont city by a brutal murder of hellish proportions, ready to banish it from Earth.  But this Hellion is direct from the Abyss, incarnate and fully possessed of all the powers of high Hell royalty - female royalty at that. It’s been said that the female of the species is deadlier than the male, and this one might be the deadliest of all.  How do you flush out such dangerous prey without recreating the chaos that befell Washington such a short time ago? The answer: bait. The bait: Declan O’Carroll, witch prodigy with powers so sweet it’s like candy for the Devil’s own. Can Chris and company catch this monster before any harm comes to their friend and colleague? Or will Hell have its way? Can they see all the angles or does this Abyss bitch have the edge?",

    "description": "<p><b>A new world. A thousand threats. Welcome to The Continent.</b></p> <p>Felix's life on Earth had become a series of dead-end jobs, ruined relationships, and rotating apartments smaller than most postage stamps. By all accounts, even his own, he was a coward. Too afraid to move forward, to take risks. Yet when given the chance to choose between risking his life or walking away from a deadly encounter, he didn't hesitate. </p> <p>Moments before his untimely demise, Felix was snatched from earth and thrust into a magical world known only as \"The Continent\". Empowered by the \"System\", he learns that he can strengthen himself through combat and dedication. To survive, he'll have to push himself beyond his limits, or else fall to the monsters all around him.</p> <p>Levels, stats, and magic. Death is the start of a terrible fate, but if he lives...no one knows what he will become.</p>",

    "description": "<p>From the producers of the Maze Runner trilogy comes this fictional oral history of the appearance of dragons on earth, starring Hayley Atwell (<i>Mission Impossible</i>), Michael Chiklis (<i>Fantastic Four</i>, <i>The Shield</i>), Aldis Hodge (<i>Justice League</i>), Greta Lee (<i>Russian Doll</i>, <i>Past Lives</i>), Jimmi Simpson (<i>Dark Matter</i>, <i>Westworld</i>), and a full cast. A riveting listen perfect for fans of <i>World War Z</i> and <i>Sleeping Giants</i>.</p> <p>Compiled by intrepid journalist Neve Pride, this archive of recordings spans the months after dragons emerged on earth, chronicling the communities that sprang up amid the destruction, the scientists, military leaders, and experts searching for a defense, and those steadfastly seeking the missing. Neve and her young daughter Bex travel among the wreckage speaking to those left behind and surviving, against all odds. Neve records everything for history, and in the hopes of locating a clue as to where the dragons came from and how one might stop them. When the defense strategy hits on a breakthrough at the same time Neve receives a lead regarding her missing son, she finds herself torn between what is personal to her and what is necessary for mankind’s survival: hope.</p> <p>Full cast of narrators include: Richard Tatum, Chioke I’Anson, Gail Shalan, Rez Kempton, Judy Gold, Piper Goodeve, Gregory Connors.</p> <p>Available in Dolby Atmos on Audible.</p>",

Hard to swallow, and just might kill him.</b></p> <p>It was good being king, or so Charlie had believed. After an abrupt crash arrival, people had finally stopped trying to kill him - for the most part, anyway - and his new subjects respected him. Or feared him. It was sort of hard to tell, what, with the ginormous dragon who had eaten the previous king standing right behind him.</p> <p>In any case, Charlie was now ruling this realm as best he knew how. And it all seemed to be going well. But he worried it wouldn’t last, and just his luck, word of a strange new threat soon reached his ears. A threat that might even have a bit of magic on their side. Of course, that was impossible on this non-magical world, but he had begun to accept that the impossible seemed to follow him wherever he went, like a hungry dog lurking in his shadow.</p> <p>Faced with an unseen enemy, Charlie had to not only keep his friends safe, but the people who looked up to King Charlie as well. It was going to be a hell of a task, and the spaceman from Earth only hoped he was up for the challenge.</p>",

    "description": "Book 4 of the Demon Accords.  Chris and Tanya have been assigned as Coven Rovers, travelling the country and troubleshooting the supernatural community. It's a job that's part cop and part auditor, one that should be long periods of boredom mixed with small parts of action. But this is Chris and Tanya, so a sudden assignment to check on a rogue vampire leads to a run-in with a hostile master vampire, a hit squad, monsters straight out of Native American folklore, black ops teams, and, worst of all, vampire politics. Now more than ever, Chris must control his dark side, as the alternative is death. ",

Conquering dungeons and using them to grow has long been the most efficient way to become a powerful adventurer. The only thing keeping the process from being easy is the Beasts that inhabit these places.

He is a Dungeon Core, a soul forced against his will into a magical stone. With the help of an energetic friend, Cal grows a dungeon around himself to bring in new sources of power.  When a threat he doesn't fully comprehend bares its many teeth, Cal is determined to survive the attempt on his life. Unfortunately for adventurers, the only way for him to achieve his goal is to eat anyone that enters his depths. ",

Without his faithful Wisp, Cal's mind slips - he begins creating traps and monsters that go against his already loose morals.  A direct threat from an unexpected force causes Cal's mind to stabilize, but he doesn't know for how long. Using every resource at his disposal, he works to keep his mind clear while he funds a search for his lost companion. When others fail him again and again, Cal takes matters into his own hands.  Deadly situations remind Dale that no matter how well he does in his secluded community, he is still considered a weakling in the greater world. Deciding that his physical and mental training are not enough, Dale resolves to gain strength by any means necessary.  Both are aware that they need to keep moving. If they stop, their choices could kill them.",

    "description": "Auras empowering the body to superhuman status. Invocations tearing the land asunder. The war has arrived. The necromantic armies are on the warpath and nowhere is safe—even the sanctuary of the flying dungeon has been threatened. The leadership of nearly all the sentient races has been wiped out, and only the people most suited to repelling the advancing darkness have an intact monarchy. Cal learns quickly that the primary threat is not the far-off war, but the actions of those entrusted with protecting the population. As it turns out, the idea of using a flying dungeon as a war machine is very tempting indeed. Dale has been facing his trials better than anyone could have hoped for, but when the war takes a turn for the worse, his role is forcibly relinquished. Since his only chance at survival is painful and rapid advancement, Dale must learn if his strength of will can develop into strength of flesh. The distance between the Heavens and the Earth might not be so far after all.",

    "description": "Unlikely allies uniting across the world. Blood feuds that span centuries. A single chance at life. The world watches the sky with trepidation. The insanity of Xenocide knew no bounds, and all will soon suffer the effects he had planned for a millennium. Though none know what is to come, they all know it isn't going to be easy to survive. The Master has a plan, one that can give the world at large a way to escape the onrushing desolation. It may be on the bleeding edge of morality and what he needs might prove too difficult to secure, but the Master asks for trust. Cal and Dale both have their role to play as the world hurtles toward destruction. One needs to bring the races of the world together while the other simply needs to survive. Surrounded by supposed allies, the duo will do all that they can to succeed - but with every new arrival comes rising tensions and faltering trust. The apocalypse is coming. Will honor or greed stand the test of time?",

It is only a matter of time before one of their foes to get lucky and draw blood.</p> <p>War brews in the horizon of Starevos, and the threat of the reborn Lord Sephar lurks in the shadows. Only Ed stands in the middle of the terrible clash of the Dark and the Light.</p> <p>This time, if Ed wants to protect those dear to him, he’ll have to unleash war and take a crown for himself.</p> <p>If he dares to pay the price.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Dark forces are threatening everything that Dungeon Lord Edward Wright cares about...and they don’t expect what they’re about to get. </p> <p>Only a few weeks have passed since the Battle of Burrova, and Edward and his friends are busier than ever improving the Haunt and protecting the surviving villagers. </p> <p>Sadly, time is a scarce commodity in the world of Ivalis. Soon enough, Ed finds himself thrown in conflict against the man behind the mindbrood’s attack, a man who is seemingly capable of shrugging off mortal wounds and who is willing to unleash a devastating plague of undead against the Haunt and everyone inside. </p> <p>Only the otherworldly powers of a Dungeon Lord may be capable of protecting the Haunt against the rapidly approaching danger...but can Edward remain the same man if he exposes himself to the corrupting influence of that very same power? </p> <p>The second installment of The Wraith's Haunt is upon us, and Soundbooth Theater had a blast producing it! In the first book, Annie Ellicott played some of SBT's creepiest monstrosities. But in this book, she's taken on the entire female cast, including Kes and Lavy who were voiced by Jeff Hays originally, and a charming new character, Katarina Locksmith, the clever thief. Annie and Jeff have been honing their vocal chemistry, and the results speak for themselves! </p> <p>The Soundbooth Theater team for this production: <br /> Jeff Hays - Narration, Characters, Production Supervision <br /> Annie Ellicott - Female voices <br /> Dalton Lynne - Proofing, Editing <br /> Griffin Malnar - Production, Editing, Mastering</p>",

    "description": "In a distant world five times the size of planet Earth, dungeons and their dungeon cores have become the top of the food chain.   Millions of dungeons inhabit the planet, utilizing the various human kingdoms as a source of much-needed mana to facilitate their own growth; in turn, the humans delve into the dungeons and acquire their own power in the form of essence, which allows them to develop and enhance themselves in a multitude of different ways.   It is a symbiotic relationship that has lasted centuries and has brought about a measure of peace.   Far in the Northern wilds where no humans (and therefore - no dungeons) regularly frequent, a young man is left alone when his parents are murdered suddenly and unexpectedly.   Now, without friends, family, or even supplies, he embarks on a journey to find out who targeted his parents - and upon whom he needs to enact his revenge.   Along the way, he discovers something about himself that his parents said was impossible from the moment he was born.   Will he learn to control the new powers he has gained, or will his newly awakened dungeon core abilities consume him?   Contains LitRPG elements such as statistics and leveling. No harems and no profanity.",

    "description": "Fred did something bad. He didn’t intend to do it, but the destruction of a dungeon core - accident or otherwise - will likely result in horrific consequences for anyone connected with the crime. And not for just the perpetrators; everyone around them will suffer vengeful retribution from the nearby cores for the unthinkable act. Knowing that his mistake will end up endangering his new friends, the townspeople of Gatecross, and even his Guild, Core Power, Fred decides to do whatever he can to protect them. After he absorbed the nature core, he unlocked the ability to establish a territory and create his very own dungeon - a dungeon which will hopefully provide the defense they need to survive against the expected fight to come. Unfortunately, the nature faction isn’t the only one that learned about Fred’s crime. The Dungeon Adventurer Syndicate, under the authority of the Craytion Kingdom, has sent a powerful group to investigate.... Contains LitRPG/GameLit elements such as statistics and leveling. No harems and no profanity.",

    "description": "<p>Twenty years have passed since Darth Bane, reigning Dark Lord of the Sith, demolished the ancient order devoted to the dark side and reinvented it as a circle of two: one Master to wield the power and pass on the wisdom, and one apprentice to learn, challenge, and ultimately usurp the Dark Lord in a duel to the death. But Bane’s acolyte, Zannah, has yet to engage her Master in mortal combat and prove herself a worthy successor. Determined that the Sith dream of galactic domination will not die with him, Bane vows to learn the secret of a forgotten Dark Lord that will assure the Sith’s immortality - and his own. </p> <p>A perfect opportunity arises when a Jedi emissary is assassinated on the troubled mining planet Doan, giving Bane an excuse to dispatch his apprentice on a fact-finding mission - while he himself sets out in secret to capture the ancient holocron of Darth Andeddu and its precious knowledge. But Zannah is no fool. She knows that her ruthless Master has begun to doubt her, and she senses that he is hiding something crucial to her future. If she is going to claim the power she craves, she must take action now. </p> <p>While Bane storms the remote stronghold of a fanatical Sith cult, Zannah prepares for her Master’s downfall by choosing an apprentice of her own: a rogue Jedi cunning and cold-blooded enough to embrace the Sith way and to stand beside her when she at last wrests from Bane the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith. </p> <p>But Zannah is not the only one with the desire and power to destroy Darth Bane. Princess Serra of the Doan royal family is haunted by memories of the monstrous Sith soldier who murdered her father and tortured her when she was a child. Bent on retribution, she hires a merciless assassin to find her tormentor - and bring him back alive to taste her wrath. </p> <p>Only a Sith who has taken down her own Master can become Dark Lord of the Sith. So when Bane suddenly vanishes, Zannah must find him - possibly even rescue him - before she can kill him. And so she pursues her quarry from the grim depths of a ravaged world on the brink of catastrophe to the barren reaches of a desert outpost, where the future of the dark side’s most powerful disciples will be decided, once and for all, by the final, fatal stroke of a lightsaber.</p>",

    "description": "Deep below a desolate Utah mountain lies the largest platinum deposit ever discovered. A billion-dollar find, it waits for any company that can drill a world-record three-mile-deep mine shaft.     EarthCore is the company with the technology, the resources, and the guts to go after the mother lode. Young executive Connell Kirkland is the company’s driving force, pushing himself and those around him to uncover the massive treasure.     But far beneath the surface, where the rocks are so hot they burn bare skin, something has been waiting for centuries. Waiting...and guarding. Kirkland is about to find out firsthand why this treasure has never been unearthed.

    "description": "Omnians, Earthers, and alliance members are fighting the Colony, the horde of sentient insectoids that threaten alliance space. The Colony has had centuries to expand through the network of domes built by the Messinants, an ancient race. The domes’ Q-gates allow the insectoids to invade planets through their inventive use of rings, which extends the power of the domes. It’s Omnian superior technology that gives a temporary advantage to the peaceful alliance members who lead the fight to retake their planets. Omnian warships and fighters, Tridents and travelers, possess beam weapons to destroy the Colony’s shuttles and transports. However, the Colony escalates, turning its transports into deadly explosive traps. In the past, the few alliance races that fought back could barely hold the line against the Colony’s seemingly never-ending incursions. Now, Jess Cinders leads a group of dedicated veterans armed with explosive dart weapons borrowed from the Loopah race. Again, it’s the Omnian advanced tech that changes the dynamics in favor of the veterans. Engineers upgrade an invention first used decades ago. It’s a shadow, a multilegged avatar, with a mounted laser. Unfortunately, for those races fighting to halt the Colony’s expansion, the insectoids aren’t willing to retreat. They fight back with even deadlier tactics that take the lives of the unwary.",

    "description": "The fate of mankind is in the hands of a group of 20-something science nerds in the sequel to Outland, by the Audible number-one best-selling author of the Bobiverse series. The Yellowstone super-eruption has put an end to modern civilization. As cities and countries continue to fall, the colony of Rivendell in the alternate Earth known as Outland looks more and more like the only real hope for humanity. But life in Rivendell isn’t getting any simpler, either. Bill and Kevin continue to discover new worlds; the population continues to rise; winter is approaching; and everyone has their own opinion about how things should be run. Then, a garbled plea for help from Omaha sends most of the security forces back Earthside to investigate, leaving Monica’s police force understaffed just as a large group of refugees arrive with its own ideas and power structure. With threats from both inside and outside, will the colony even survive until spring?",

    "description": "<p>In 2005, Brandon Sanderson debuted with <i>Elantris</i>, an epic fantasy unlike any other then on the market. To celebrate its tenth anniversary, Tor is reissuing <i>Elantris</i> in a special edition, a fresh chance to introduce it to the myriad readers who have since become Sanderson fans. </p> <p>This new edition begins with a preface by author Dan Wells, the first person to read the completed novel, and a new afterword by Sanderson explaining how he came to write the book and its place in the Cosmere, the unified universe of all his Tor novels.</p> <p>Also included is an expanded version of the \"Ars Arcanum\" appendix, with more of the technical details of the book's magic that fans can never get enough of. </p> <p><i>Elantris</i> was truly a milestone both for Sanderson and for the genre of epic fantasy. It deserves this special treatment, something Tor has done only once before, with Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game. Sanderson fans old and new will be excited to discover it. </p>",

    "description": "Two crises challenge the Omnians. Alex Racine’s fleet draws a first-contact conflict, which faces the Ollassa, a symbiotic flora race. The Omnian fleet sails from alliance space in an effort to interdict an alien ship that arrives at the Worlds of Lights, the Ollassa system. Soon after arriving, the alien ship deploys machines to scour asteroids for resources in the system’s far belt. Alex’s fleet arrives too late to prevent the Ollassa from attempting to oust the interlopers. The ill-equipped Ollassa attack the harvesting machines, and alien fighters destroy every Ollassa ship. The Omnians find not a single piece of debris from the alien fighters. The Ollassa fail to score one kill. The fleet’s SADEs, self-aware digital entities, make contact with the aliens and discover an artificial intelligence (AI) guides the ship and its defenses. Omnians are reminded of recent encounters with AIs, none of which have been good. Wary of the new AI, precautions are taken.  Alex’s first-contact efforts are embroiled in a mire of political conflict. A highly structured race exists aboard the alien ship. Those individuals, who live in the core, service the elites who inhabit the arches. One elite, the Deloy, rules the ship and the AI. Alex must broker a shift in the ship’s political structure to balance the power within the alien race. Afterward, he must deal with the Ollassa losses. During these delicate steps, the fleet prepares against the launch of the alien ship’s fleet of deadly fighters.",

    "description": "Trouble infiltrated the Harakens' capital city of Espero, in the form of New Terra criminal gangs who grew wealthy and powerful on the moons of Ganymede, hiding behind the cover of an ill-conceived mining charter. The gangs brought stims and addictive hallucinogenic drugs to Espero, distributing them to the young on the planet.  Christie Racine and her friends visited a hidden club rumored to be a source of the dangerous drugs and have run afoul of the criminals running the illegal establishment. Kidnapped and transported out of Hellébore's system aboard a freighter, the girls become desperate to free themselves.  Alex Racine, Christie's brother and president of the Harakens, races to discover where the girls were taken. The trail leads Alex from Espero to the pleasure domes of Jolares, a moon orbiting a gas giant in Oistos, the New Terrans' home system. Alex's search is complicated by the discovery of not one, but three sets of pleasure domes, each on its own moon and run by its own criminal mastermind.  It becomes a dangerous game of hide-and-seek as the Harakens attempt to recover their girls and locate the biochemist who created the dangerous hallucinogen, without panicking the kidnappers. The Harakens' efforts are complicated by the duplicitous scheme of \"Mr. Blue\" and \"Sniffer\", two gang leaders, who seek to steal the domes of \"Craze\", the third gang leader, in a dangerous double-cross.  Alex and his people thought things couldn't get any more complicated until they discover the gangs have gone to war with deadly stunners and plasma rifles in a fight for possession of the Haraken girls, who are caught between the rivals.

While his team is working hard to increase their knowledge, train their skills, and grow a paradise, the Murderhobo steps into a Descender portal for five minutes, pops out, jumping straight into Murder World—fists leading the way. Life is good.<br /> <br /> After years of work, Andre the Druid makes a grievous error: He completes his job perfectly. By healing the Scarroco Desert, the supermassive Dynasty that neighbors the Hollow Kingdom suddenly has renewed interest in their resources. No longer content to leave The Four in exile, the King recalls them to the Palace. Before their new orders are given, the Dynasty steals something precious from the King. Going after it is a fool's errand.<br /> <br /> That works perfectly for the King: he knows exactly four disposable Ascenders. Being promised freedom, luxuries, and cushy jobs if they are successful—and death upon failure—Luke’s team leaves immediately. As they begin their adventure through the front lines of the invasion, Luke the Murderhobo knows it’s his moment to shine. Monsters, Ascenders, and Assassins are the least of their worries.<br /> <br /> All he needs to do is survive everything.</p>",

I was just better prepared to do it than most folks.\"In the years since the wave of living death swept the globe, St George and his fellow heroes haven't just kept Los Angeles' last humans alive - they've created a real community, a bustling town that's spreading beyond its original walls and swelling with new refugees. But now one of the heroes, perhaps the most powerful among them, seems to be losing his mind. The implacable enemy known as Legion has found terrifying new ways of using zombies as pawns in his attacks. And outside the Mount, something ancient and monstrous is hell-bent on revenge.As Peter Clines weaves these elements together in yet another masterful, shocking climax, St. George, Stealth, Captain Freedom, and the rest of the heroes find that even in a city overrun by millions of ex-humans... there's more than one way to come back from the dead.",

Crusaders for justice, using their superhuman abilites to make Los Angeles a better place. Then the plague of living death spread around the globe. Despite the best efforts of the superheroes, the police, and the military, the hungry corpses rose up and overwhelmed the country. The population was decimated, heroes fell, and the city of angels was left a desolate zombie wasteland like so many others.  Now, a year later, the Mighty Dragon and his companions must overcome their differences and recover from their own scars to protect the thousands of survivors sheltered in their film studio-turned-fortress, the Mount. The heroes lead teams out to scavenge supplies, keep the peace within the walls of their home, and try to be the symbols the survivors so desperately need. For while the ex-humans walk the streets night and day, they are not the only threat left in the world, and the people of the Mount are not the only survivors left in Los Angeles. Across the city, another group has grown and gained power. And they are not heroes.",

    "description": "It’s been two years since the world ended. Two years since the dead rose and the plague of ex-humanity decimated mankind. For most of that time, the superhero called St. George, formerly known to the world as the Mighty Dragon, has protected the people of Los Angeles at their film-studio-turned-fortress, The Mount. Together with his fellow heroes - Cerberus, Zzzap, and Stealth - he’s tried to give the survivors hope and something like a real life. But the swollen population of The Mount is becoming harder and harder to sustain, and the heroes are feeling the pressure.  Hope arrives in the form of a United States Army battalion, based in a complex a few hundred miles away in Arizona. This is not just any base, however. The men and women of Project Krypton are super-soldiers, designed and created before the outbreak to be better, stronger, and faster than normal humans. They want the heroes and all the people of The Mount to rejoin America and have normal lives again.  But can the military be trusted? And is there even a country left to rejoin? There is a secret at the heart of Project Krypton, and those behind it have an awesome power that will help them keep that secret hidden. The power of Freedom.  BONUS SHORT STORY: Ex-Patriots includes \"Codependent\", one of four interlocking stories from The Junkie Quatrain by Peter Clines.",

Five days a week he coaxes his old Hyundai to life, curses the Los Angeles traffic, and clocks in at his job as a handyman at the local college. But when he sleeps, George dreams of something more. George dreams of flying. He dreams of fighting monsters. He dreams of a man made of pure lightning, an armored robot, a giant in an army uniform, a beautiful woman who moves like a ninja.  Then one day as he’s walking from one fix-it job to the next, a pale girl in a wheelchair tells George of another world, one in which civilization fell to a plague that animates the dead…and in which George is no longer a glorified janitor, but one of humanity’s last heroes. Her tale sounds like madness, of course. But as George’s dreams and his waking life begin bleeding together, he starts to wonder - which is the real world, and which is just fantasy?",

So its decision to help the only human who ever showed it respect must be a system glitch, right?  Having traveled the width of the galaxy to unearth details of its own murderous transgressions, as well as those of the GrayCris Corporation, Murderbot is heading home to help Dr. Mensah - its former owner (protector? friend?) - submit evidence that could prevent GrayCris from destroying more colonists in its never-ending quest for profit.

    "description": "The year is 1989. Callsign: Dark Horse and his Marine Rapid Reaction Force team have been sent to recover a strange artifact near Antarctica’s Soviet-controlled Vostok Station. Confronted by a team of Ruskie Spetsnaz, a battle for control of the strange device, frozen in the ice, breaks out. But before anyone can claim victory, or the prize, an explosion of white light knocks the combatants unconscious and whisks them away to... 2989. One thousand years later. Dark Horse, along with his teammate, Chuy, and one of the Soviets, Drago, finds himself in a future that is both impressive and horrifying. Humanity has left Earth behind and is rapidly expanding throughout the galaxy under the banner of The Union, a white supremacist government who racially ‘purified’ the human race hundreds of years in the past. Living on the fringe of this twisted Fourth Reich society, Dark Horse - the only Black man in the Union - commandeers a vessel and scours the galaxy for his missing teammates under the guise of an Exo-Hunter, seeking out exo-planets to satiate the Union’s need for colonization. His search takes him beyond the edge of the known universe and into an interplanetary war, guided by a vast intelligence that’s been waiting for Dark Horse’s arrival - for a thousand years. New York Times and number-one Audible.com best-selling author Jeremy Robinson takes readers on a journey to a dark and twisted future…and makes them laugh. Exo-Hunter is a lighthearted homage to 1980s science fiction movies that also looks at the dangers of white supremacy and the core values that makes it dangerous and the butt of the joke. In the audiobook edition, he is joined by number-one Audible best-selling narrator, R.C. Bray, giving listeners the most compelling - and most fun - thing to come out of 2020.",

Beyond the reach of the nuclear infernos, the masterminds survived and continue their assault on outposts across the Allied States. Timothy Temper and Sergeant Ruckley narrowly escaped one of those attacks. On the run from hostile forces, they fight to get an urgent message to command - the monsters aren’t the only threat. Their human allies have a nuclear weapon.  Refusing to hide underground, President Jan Ringgold heads to New York. Doctor Kate Lovato and her team are there working to infiltrate and sabotage enemy communications. To buy them time, S.M. Fischer and his engineers deploy technology to detect incoming Variant attacks. But they can’t hold the monsters for much longer.  Deep in enemy territory, Master Sergeant Fitzpatrick and Captain Beckham discover the terrifying truth behind the New Gods and a plan even more nefarious than eliminating the human race. This time, the future depends not just on the survival of Team Ghost, but their ability to convince new allies to join the fight before it’s too late.",

    "description": "Darkness descends over the survivors of the Extinction Cycle....  With nowhere left to run, the Allied States fortifies their few remaining outposts and relocates Central Command to prepare for their final stand. President Jan Ringgold and her generals know beating the enemy on the battlefield is impossible. The only path to victory seems to be taking down the leader of the New Gods, a sinister Chimera known as the Prophet, before he can complete his campaign to enslave humanity.  While Captain Reed Beckham trains new troops, his wife Doctor Kate Lovato returns to the tunnels to infiltrate the bioengineered enemy communication network. Injured and exhausted, Master Sergeant Fitzpatrick and Team Ghost make their way back from Canada with a Chimera prisoner that might be the key to finding the Prophet and raising a new army.  In this thrilling conclusion to the Extinction Cycle series, humanity bands together one last time against the Variants. But time has run out for the heroes of the first war to save what remains of the Allied States and, perhaps, the world.",

    "description": "The government said the Variants were dying off.... That the beasts would be extinct in a matter of years.... That the Allied States had returned to prosperity and freedom.... The government was dead wrong. Deep under the cities, the Variants weren't just hiding, they were breeding. While the human survivors of the Extinction Cycle built outposts and brought back industries, the monsters were building something of their own. Working with human collaborators, they constructed a vast underground organic network to control this new army and launch a blitzkrieg assault across the Allied States. After tunneling under the walls, the beasts managed to overwhelm even the most fortified outposts. Many of them fell within days, forcing the military to abandon bases and retreat.  But not everyone is on the run. Team Ghost hunts a monster behind enemy lines that could change the tide of war. On the USS George Johnson, Doctor Kate Lovato and her team of scientists seek to understand and tap in to the Variant network while oil tycoon S. M. Fischer and his engineers come up with a plan to help buy time for the remaining outposts. And, at Outpost Portland, Captain Reed Beckham and Master Sergeant Parker Horn investigate a frightening conspiracy involving the human collaborators.  As the Variant armies surge across the Allied States, those working to stop them realize even desperate measures may not be enough to prevent the total annihilation of their country.",

    "description": "They thought they survived the extinction cycle, but a powerful evil lurks in the shadows...Now old and new heroes join forces to save what’s left of the world in this thrilling sci-fi audio adventure.  Eight years ago, an engineered virus ravaged the globe, infecting and transforming humans into apex predators called Variants. Billions died, civilization collapsed, and the human race teetered on the brink of extinction. Nations banded together and heroes rose up to fight these abominations. On the front lines, Captain Reed Beckham and Master Sergeant Joe \"Fitz\" Fitzpatrick of Delta Force Team Ghost fought against the Variant hordes. With the aid of CDC Doctor Kate Lovato, they helped lead humanity to victory. Now, almost a decade after the end of the war, civilization has slowly clawed toward recovery. In the Allied States of America, survivors live in outposts where they have rebuilt industry, agriculture, and infrastructure. The remaining Variants are believed to be dying off under destroyed cities and the abandoned frontier. But evil and intelligent forces dwell in the shadows with the starving beasts, scheming to restart the extinction cycle and end humanity forever. And once again, Beckham, Fitz, and Kate will rise to fight them, along with new heroes to try and save what remains of the world. R. C. Bray brings to life the beloved characters of this series and expertly depicts their turmoil and struggle for survival. Note: This new season is a self-contained storyline. Listeners do not have to hear the first seven books of the Extinction Cycle to jump into book one of Extinction Cycle: Dark Age. For returning listeners, this audiobook takes place after book seven, Extinction War. ",

After turning an ancient vampire to dust and stirring the Coven into a mob of pitchfork-and-torch-bearing vampires, Chris Gordon thinks it might be time for a road trip. So, leaving Tanya to calm the troubled masses, he heads south to help a North Carolina pack with some demon troubles. But with beautiful Stacia Reynolds in the shotgun seat and his trusty companion, Awasos, Chris just might find more trouble out of the Big Apple than in it as he follows the blacktop south. It's demons and witches and bears, oh my. ",

Join the millions of listeners who have enjoyed R.C. Bray’s hilarious portrayal of Joe, Skippy, the Merry Band of Pirates, and so many other unforgettable characters.  The problem with lying about having a super weapon is that the bad guys might believe they have nothing to lose by doing something stupid that both sides will regret. Or, they might just call your bluff. Either way, the Merry Band of Pirates need a plan to deal with the Fallout.",

Despite being an expert shoveler, it’s not his top career choice, and he’s anxious to take any \"legitimate\" criminal work that comes along. In that vein, he finds himself hired by a mysterious woman who wants him to recover an even more mysterious trunk that was stolen from her mansion. He’s also tasked by the new Adjunct Overwatch to find out who has been tampering with the Upper City. Hank struggles against competitive rivals, government red tape, serial killers, and his ever-present grumbling stomach. All of this takes place with the backdrop of the Thad Elon Festival. It was put on as a means to drum up tourism revenue for the city. But there’s a concern that the destructive demigod in question might show up in person to take part in the celebration.",

    "description": "Some heroes are born, some are made, and some are willing to fake it for the right pay. Gabe abandoned life as a conman after the disasters in Lincoln, and he managed to carve out a bit of peace with the scraps he had left. Unfortunately, bad guys suck at respecting personal boundaries. So, together with Heather and a group of weird new companions, he finds himself shackled to a horrifying cosmic game with sky-high stakes, inscrutable goals, and rules that seem to change every five minutes. And when old gods and monsters resurface to make things so much worse, he's finally forced to admit that he might not be talking his way past any of it. Fate itself rises to force-feed Gabe a cliché quest, leaving him only to find the artifact, get paid the fortune, and try to make it out alive...and if there's enough time, maybe save the whole stupid world. Fate Lashed is the sequel to Hero Forged and is the second audiobook in the Ethereal Earth series - an ongoing tale about the nightmares we create, those they create for us, and a few people who refuse to take any of it too seriously.",

Piloted by a six-year-old girl, the godlike Skalm guards the Districts of TASC. Her family is long dead. Her adopted father is a synthetic copy of an alien, her nanny an artificial mind connected via subspace to every part of the globe, feeding the young girl information, finding prey to satiate her growing thirst.  But the young girl is an innocent, a victim, one of millions the war has already claimed. Her innocence has been sacrificed by a man with singular purpose: a man who will stop at nothing in order to prepare Earth for the coming conflict.  The armada is approaching, its far-off engines now bright as stars in the night sky. They mean to kill us. They have the power to do so. And as oblivion's maw opens up to engulf us, we brace ourselves for battle.  We will fight to the last. Live or die, we will leave a scar upon our attackers that will last an age, even if we ourselves do not. ",

    "description": "\"Real science in Science Fiction. This is a must read for fans of SF.\" >(John S. Gertsch, Amazon Reviewer)  Perfect for fans of Peter F. Hamilton, Iain M. Banks, and Orson Scott Card, Fear the Sky is a hard-hitting sci-fi thriller that will have you looking at the stars in a different way.  In eleven years' time, a million members of an alien race will arrive at Earth. Years before they enter orbit, their approach will be announced by the flare of a thousand flames in the sky, their ships' huge engines burning hard to slow them from the vast speeds needed to cross interstellar space. These foreboding lights will shine in our night sky like new stars, getting ever brighter until they outshine even the sun, casting ominous shadows and banishing the night until they suddenly blink out. Their technology is vastly superior to ours, and they know they cannot possibly lose the coming conflict. But they, like us, have found no answer to the destructive force of the atom, and they have no intention of facing the onslaught of our primitive nuclear arsenal or the devastation it would wreak on the planet they crave. So they have flung out an advance party in front of them, hidden within one of the countless asteroids randomly roaming the void. They do not want us, they want our planet. Their Agents are arriving.",

    "description": "The Earth lies shaken in the aftermath of a conspiracy. Some of the smartest minds on the planet have striven for and died in an effort to scour the skies of four vast alien satellites, but their success has brought a terrible vengeance down upon us.  While alien agents stalk the Earth, a team of exhausted scientists and military outcasts struggle to fight them among a planet on the brink - the brink of plague, the brink of war, and the brink of an invasion larger than they can possibly imagine. But they have allies. Two of the alien agents have forsaken their homes, their families, and their very species to stop the greatest act of genocide any of them has ever known. They carry with them the knowledge we need to save humanity and take us into a new and marvelous age.  But Lana and the remaining enemy agents are far from defeated. As they begin to reap havoc among the diseased and bereft, Neal, Ayala, and Barrett must find a way to achieve the impossible - by fair means or foul, they must unite the world's disparate nations. And they must do so quickly, for the Armada is fast approaching, and behind the great fires of their decelerating engines, the huge fleet is readying itself for war. ",

If it's just a thing, how can it commit murder?

There's a werewolf with pre-lunar tension in the city, and a dwarf with attitude and a golem who's begun to think for itself, but that's just ordinary trouble. The real problem is more puzzling - people are being murdered, but there's no trace of anything alive having been at the crime scene.<br /> <br /> So Vimes not only has to find out whodunit, but howdunit too. He's not even sure what they dun. But soon as he knows what the questions are, he's going to want some answers.<br /> <br /> <i>The Discworld novels can be listened to in any order but </i><b><i>Feet of Clay </i></b><i>is the third book in the City Watch series.</i><br /> <br /> <b>'The work of a prolific humorist at his best' </b><i>Observer</i><br /> <br /> </p>",

    "description": "<p>Martin and his friends discovered that their world is computer generated and that by altering the code, they could alter reality. They traveled back in time to Medieval England to live as wizards. Almost everything they've done since then has, in one way or another, blown up in their faces. </p> <p>So of course they decide to make dragons. It does not go well. </p> <p>As the wizards struggle to control their creations and protect innocent citizens, they try new things (most of which they don't enjoy), meet new people (most of who are angry at them), and fight epic battles (most of which they lose). </p> <p>But their biggest challenge may be a young girl who knows that the wizards created the dragons and is determined to make them pay. On her side she has powerful allies, a magical artifact, and a faithful if not particularly helpful dog. </p> <p><i>Fight and Flight</i> is a rollicking tale of bravery, wonder, love, revenge, greed, discovery, deception, and animal husbandry. </p>",

    "description": "<p><b>Life changed the moment the Heavens granted Benedict his Regeneration Sphere.</b></p> <p>Stepping out of the abusive cycle he'd known all his life, Benedict entered the Gilfle Academy. Getting help from his therapist, Agatha Carper, he was ready to try his new lease on life. It wasn't without its bumps and setbacks, but he wasn't going to give up on this second chance.</p> <p>Benedict's first bump was his new roommate, Atropos Foxglove. The young woman had a painful past that'd colored her view of life, especially when it came to men. The two stumbled and even argued but eventually found their footing to coexist. That coexistence even turned into a friendship that grew as the semester went on.</p> <p>It was the second bump that almost ended Benedict's new life prematurely. Ellen Rox had long hated Atropos, and she wasn't above hurting others. Seeing Benedict with Atropos, Ellen chose to use him as her pawn and bring more grief into Atropos' life. That all culminated in Benedict being accused of sexual assault, a fabrication put on by Ellen and her cronies.</p> <p>The false charges were stopped only with some help, but they also led Atropos and Benedict to become closer. Friendship forged through adversity—including their own past traumas—made for a bedrock to build on.</p> <p>They wouldn't be building their friendship alone, though, as they'd both found peers who they could count on. Their best mutual friend was named Sadie Somnius, a slightly older woman who was also their gym coach. She might be brash and far more aggressive than either Benedict or Atropos, but she also helped bring the two of them closer.</p> <p>With the semester at an end, the three friends were separated for the tournament that the Academy held with its contemporaries. Benedict and Atropos would be facing the best of each Academy in a mock war. After that, they'd strive to delve into the Pockets and pull out more rewards than anyone else. Winning one or both could propel them farther along their path of ascending to the Heavens.</p>",

Newcago is free. They told David it was impossible, that even the Reckoners had never killed a High Epic. Yet Steelheart - invincible, immortal, unconquerable - is dead. And he died by David's hand.  Eliminating Steelheart was supposed to make life simpler. Instead, it only made David realize he has questions. Big ones. And no one in Newcago can give him answers.  Babylon Restored, the city formerly known as the borough of Manhattan, has possibilities, though. Ruled by the mysterious High Epic Regalia, Babylon Restored is flooded and miserable, but David is sure it's the path that will lead him to what he needs to find. Entering a city oppressed by a High Epic despot is risky, but David's willing to take the gamble. Because killing Steelheart left a hole in David's heart. A hole where his thirst for vengeance once lived. Somehow, he filled that hole with another Epic - Firefight. And now he will go on a quest darker and even more dangerous than the fight against Steelheart to find her, and to get his answers.",

    "description": "<p>Things are not well within the Lodrak Empire. An entire city goes up in smoke and ash, and an entire province is slowly being consumed by an ever-expanding cloud of death.</p> <p>But while the humans rally to contain the fallout of this disaster, they are much quicker to pin the blame for it on their elven neighbors to the north. With centuries' worth of strife and bad blood between the two nations flaring up, all out war is rapidly becoming an inevitability.</p> <p>Powerful figures are already on the move. Some wish to unravel the mystery behind the dead city in order to bring the perpetrators to justice. Others are more than content enough to use this \"act of terrorism\" as an excuse to further the Empire's agenda. A select few are even planning on somehow turning this cataclysm into a weapon for the sake of their ambitions. The elves of the Ishigar Republic are hard at work undermining and sabotaging their old enemy, while the international community watches the ongoing situation with a critical eye. Even the Gods themselves are closely monitoring the situation, ready to intervene should they deem it necessary.</p> <p>However, though all these entities have different reasons and methods, they all have the same objective - to find the mastermind responsible for setting all this in motion.</p> <p>The same \"mastermind\" that is far too busy figuring out how wagons work to notice the world is stirring.</p> <p><i>Content warning: Profanity, gore, violence, explicit adult content.</i></p>",

At the same time, a certain ill-tempered Lyonette is squatting in Erin’s inn, and Goblins are on the move. The Goblin Lord’s threat reaches across the entire region, and the Redfang tribe has rallied against him with the Floodplains tribe, although their Chieftains do not agree on some crucial matters.... The continent of Izril is rife with change as a young man named Laken Godart finds himself lost like all the others. Being naturally blind does not increase his odds of survival, either, but with luck, he might survive the winter. This winter, there is only snow, Goblins, magic, and iambic pentameter. ",

    "description": "Lost in time, the town of Black Creek, Kentucky becomes home to temporal layers of people, creatures, and monsters from disparate eras. Journey beyond the time of humanity and witness the rewriting of mankind’s genesis. For Owen McCoy, a typical day on the job as head of security for Synergy, a research company conducting mysterious experiments, is boring at best. And that’s the way he likes it. Patrolling the Appalachian mountainside, where his now deceased father taught him how to hunt, is relaxing and connects him to the past. But today is not a typical day on the job. It begins with asking a thief to join him for breakfast. Seeking to set the young man on a better path, Owen invites him to walk the perimeter with him and consider a more honest living. Before their patrol can begin, they discover evidence that the facility has been breached. When Owen’s truck explodes, he’s confused, but ready for whatever might come his way. At least, he thinks he is. A wave of light-bending energy - the Flux - rolls down the mountainside, transporting Owen, and everyone in the nearby town of Black Creek, to October 14, 1985, the day before his father died. Two hours later, the second Flux hits, and then a third, and a fourth, each time collecting Black Creek residents from various times. They’re carried through eras filled with wild animals, monsters of myth, and ancient beasts...and then beyond. Joined by a ragtag group of temporal stowaways, including family members, Owen fights to restore order, stop the Flux, and return home, facing off against futuristic tech, primal killers, and the fear of losing his father...again. International bestselling author of The Others and Infinite, Jeremy Robinson combines science, action, and strong characters to create an ever-changing landscape that explores the past, the human condition, and the lengths people will go to save those they love.",

    "description": "The highly anticipated sequel to Audible's Best of 2016 - Science Fiction winner, We Are Legion (We Are Bob); a book listeners are calling \"so much fun\", \"what science fiction was meant to be\", and what would happen if \"Andy Weir and Ernest Cline had a lovechild\".  Bob Johansson didn't believe in an afterlife, so waking up after being killed in a car accident was a shock. To add to the surprise, he is now a sentient computer and the controlling intelligence for a Von Neumann probe.  Bob and his copies have been spreading out from Earth for 40 years now, looking for habitable planets. But that's the only part of the plan that's still in one piece. A system-wide war has killed off 99.9 percent of the human race; nuclear winter is slowly making the Earth uninhabitable; a radical group wants to finish the job on the remnants of humanity; the Brazilian space probes are still out there, still trying to blow up the competition; and the Bobs have discovered a spacefaring species that sees all other life as food.  Bob left Earth anticipating a life of exploration and blissful solitude. Instead he's become a sky god to a primitive native species, the only hope for getting humanity to a new home, and possibly the only thing that can prevent every living thing in the local sphere from ending up as dinner.  Listener favorite Ray Porter returns to narrate Bob - and his many incarnations - in all of their geeky glory.  For We Are Many is the second installment in the blockbuster Audible Original Bobiverse series - which has sold more than one million copies.",

In Forbidden Island, he brings the characters and plotting of the fastest paced thrillers together with mind-bending imaginative horrors. Seeking to contact humanity's lost tribe.... On the precipice of a cliff, contemplating suicide, dishonorably discharged US Army Ranger Rowan Baer is invited to provide security to a research team visiting the most dangerous island in the world - North Sentinel Island in the Sea of Bengal. Seeking redemption, he accepts. Living among Amazon rainforest tribes, eccentric Israeli anthropologist Talia Mayer is recruited to study the island's elusive inhabitants - the Sentinelese - who have resided on the tropical island since the dawn of mankind. Seeing the chance of a lifetime, she joins the team. On the run from his past, Palestinian linguist Mahdi Barakat is given little choice: join the expedition and make contact with the Sentinelese, or be left to face the men tracking him down. Afraid for his life, he finds safe harbor halfway around the world. As part of an expedition funded by the Indian government and supported by a local resort millionaire, the team struggles to make contact with the Sentinelese, a tribal people renowned for their violence, strange behavior, and mysterious ways. But when the expedition's yacht strikes a reef, and sinks, the team finds themselves stranded on an island few people have ever set foot on and survived, an island that they quickly discover is home to far more than primitive tribal people. ...They uncover the very source of evil.",

    "description": "Gifted with meta-human powers in a world full of capes and villains, Tori Rivas kept away from the limelight, preferring to work as a thief in the shadows. But when she's captured trying to rob a vault that belongs to a secret guild of villains, she's offered a hard choice: prove she has what it takes to join them or be eliminated.  Apprenticed to one of the world's most powerful (and supposedly dead) villains, she is thrust into a strange world where the lines that divide superheroes and criminals are more complex than they seem. The education of a villain is not an easy one, and Tori will have to learn quickly if she wants to survive. On top of the peril she faces from her own teacher, there are also the capes and fellow apprentices to worry about, to say nothing of having to keep up a civilian cover.  Most dangerous of all, though, are those who loathe the guild's very existence. Old grudges mean some are willing to go to any length to see the guild turned to ash, along with each one of its members. Even the lowly apprentices. ",

He knows that the serpents must be dealt with, but watching the Sidhe forces take the nodes near his old home, and turn them violet, is weighing on him. Even worse than the external threat is the pressing fact that the gathered humans are beginning to fracture into factions with competing desires. The mana shield over the stadium was supposed to solve every one of their problems. The Naga disagreed, and their frequent skirmishes are ramping up into a constant drain on resources. Drew’s only possible response to the humans, the aliens, and the strange, urban jungle appearing across the Potomac is to increase the count of his own red nodes and build up his strength; all in a race to save humanity. As tensions rise, Drew wonders more and more if he can solve everything with a well-placed fireball.",

    "description": "The New York Times best-selling security droid with a heart (though it wouldn't admit it!) is back in Fugitive Telemetry!  Having captured the hearts of audiences across the globe (Annalee Newitz says it's \"one of the most humane portraits of a nonhuman I've ever read\"), Murderbot has also established Martha Wells as one of the great SF writers of today.  No, I didn't kill the dead human. If I had, I wouldn't dump the body in the station mall.  When Murderbot discovers a dead body on Preservation Station, it knows it is going to have to assist station security to determine who the body is (was), how they were killed (that should be relatively straightforward, at least), and why (because apparently that matters to a lot of people - who knew?).  Yes, the unthinkable is about to happen: Murderbot must voluntarily speak to humans!  Again!",

Beam Piper's 1962 sci-fi classic <i>Little Fuzzy</i>, written with the full cooperation of the Piper Estate, Jack Holloway works alone for reasons he doesn't care to talk about. On the distant planet Zarathustra, Jack is content as an independent contractor for ZaraCorp, prospecting and surveying at his own pace. As for his past, that's not up for discussion. </p> <p>Then, in the wake of an accidental cliff collapse, Jack discovers a seam of unimaginably valuable jewels, to which he manages to lay legal claim just as ZaraCorp is cancelling their contract with him for his part in causing the collapse. Briefly in the catbird seat, legally speaking, Jack pressures ZaraCorp into recognizing his claim, and cuts them in as partners to help extract the wealth. </p> <p>But there's another wrinkle to ZaraCorp's relationship with the planet Zarathustra. Their entire legal right to exploit the verdant Earth-like planet, the basis of the wealth they derive from extracting its resources, is based on being able to certify to the authorities on Earth that Zarathustra is home to no sentient species. Then a small furry biped - trusting, appealing, and ridiculously cute - shows up at Jack's outback home. Followed by its family. As it dawns on Jack that despite their stature, these are people, he begins to suspect that ZaraCorp's claim to a planet's worth of wealth is very flimsy indeed and that ZaraCorp may stop at nothing to eliminate the fuzzys before their existence becomes more widely known.</p>",

    "description": "Meet the galaxy's unluckiest outlaws. Carl Ramsey is an ex-Earth Navy fighter pilot turned con man. His ship, the Mobius, is home to a ragtag crew of misfits and refugees looking to score a big payday but more often just scratching to pay for fuel. The crew consists of his ex-wife (and pilot), a drunkard, four-handed mechanic, a xeno-predator with the disposition of a 120kg housecat, and the galaxy's most-wanted wizard. Along the way, the Mobius crew crosses paths with the Black Ocean's vilest scum, from pirate fleets to criminal syndicates, and most law-abiding scum, including Earth Interstellar Enhanced Investigative Organization, ARGO high command, and the Convocation of Wizards. Time and again, riches lie just out of reach, because for all the talents Carl Ramsey and his crew possess, they've also got an outlaw's greatest weakness: a conscience.  Galaxy Outlaws is a collection of all 16 Black Ocean missions chronicling the adventures of the starship Mobius and her crew, along with six short stories. This series is the perfect cure for the Firefly Season 2 blues. It's what you'd get if The Orville took place on Serenity, or if Star Wars had wizards instead of Jedi.",

It’s whispered that behind every mysterious death lurks a Quadrad. But when Garm enters the wide galaxy, she finds her prestigious training entirely insufficient.  Most Quadrad are abysmal failures, unable to cope in an advanced technological empire. The Quadrad are nothing but a very clever marketing campaign that has been going on for 20,000 years. But Garm is different. She is determined to be the most successful, most lethal, and richest “agent of change” in history. To that end, she assembles the best spaceship crew she can afford. Unfortunately, she is extremely poor. Her ship is a former pleasure cruise vessel, the Summer Dream Adventure. And her crew is made up of ancient relics, war criminals, incomprehensible aliens, nymphomaniacs, and creatures so dangerous, just being near them can prove fatal. To make matters worse, Garm is personally being hunted by the government, which seeks to forcibly put an end to the Quadrad myth forever.",

    "description": "<p>The thrilling conclusion to The Extinction Files is finally here! </p> <p>A code hidden in the human genome...will reveal the ultimate secret of human existence. </p> <p>And could hold humanity's only hope of survival. </p> <p>In 2003, the first human genome was sequenced. But the secrets it held were never revealed. </p> <p>The truth was discovered 30 years ago, almost by accident. Dr. Paul Kraus had spent his entire career searching for what he called humanity's lost tribes - human ancestors who had gone extinct. When Kraus compared the DNA samples of the lost tribes with our own, he found a pattern of changes: a code. At the time, the technology didn't exist to unravel what it meant. To protect the secret, Kraus hid his work and disappeared. Now the technology exists to finally understand the mysterious code buried in the human genome, but finding the pieces of Kraus' research is more dangerous than anyone imagined. </p> <p>Dr. Peyton Shaw and her mother have obtained part of Kraus' research - and a cryptic message that could lead to the remaining pieces. They believe his work is the key to stopping a global conspiracy - and an event that will change humanity forever. </p> <p>The ultimate secret, buried in the human genome, will change our very understanding of what it means to be human. For Peyton, finding it may come at an incredible price. She must weigh the lives of strangers against those she loves: Desmond Hughes and her mother. With time running out, Peyton makes a fateful choice - one that can never be undone. </p>",

Unfortunately being dead doesn't make Harry's life any easier.  Trapped between life and death, he learns that his friends are in serious trouble.

Worse still are the malevolent shadows that roam Chicago, controlled by a dark entity that wants Harry to suffer even in death.  Now the late Harry Dresden will have to pull off the ultimate trick without using any magic - or face an eternity as just another lost soul....",

The former are seen as hardcore traditionalists hell-bent on maintaining the status quo, while the latter only look ever forward and upward as they grasp at the future with both hands. And yet, these two seemingly opposing cultures serve as a counter-balance to each other, creating a civilization that draws upon the wisdom of the past to face new challenges. Whether that is actually the case or mere propaganda will soon to be put to the test, as they are about to receive a visit from the Hero of Chaos. The enigmatic herald of change has already fostered a well-deserved reputation for setting things in motion by their presence, and only time will tell if the Kingdom of the stout-folk will survive the impending transition.</p> <p>Though, once again, Boxxy doesn't actually care what ripples it causes. It isn't there to upset society or challenge the stagnant culture of all-work-no-play. Its goal is to track down an errant treasure that escaped its grasp while it was out of commission, and maybe secure some new pieces for its ever-growing collection along the way. Before it has a chance to, however, it must first deal with a significant issue that threatens to undo much of its work since its arrival in Azurvale. It is a challenge unlike any it has faced, and not one that it can hope to solve easily through force and violence. The limits of Boxxy's patience and self-control are about to be tested, as it looks desperately for a way...to leave the house.</p> <p><b>Content Warning: Profanity, gore, violence, explicit adult content</b></p>",

One hundred thousand years ago. In the wake of the apparent self-destruction of the alien Forerunner empire, two humans - Chakas and Riser - are like flotsam washed up on very strange shores indeed. Captured by the Forerunner known as the Master Builder and then misplaced during a furious battle in space, Chakas and Riser now find themselves on an inverted world where horizons rise into the sky and humans of all kinds are trapped in a perilous cycle of horror and neglect. They have become both research animals and strategic pawns in a cosmic game whose madness knows no end - a game of ancient vengeance between the powers who seeded the galaxy with life and the Forerunners who expect to inherit their sacred Mantle of Responsibility to all living things. In the company of a young girl and an old man, Chakas begins an epic journey across a lost and damaged Halo ringworld in search of a way home, an explanation for the warrior spirits rising up within, and the reason for the Forerunner Librarian’s tampering with human destiny. Their travels will take them into the domain of a powerful and monstrous intelligence - known as “the Captive” by Forerunners and “the Primordial” by ancient human warriors, this being may not only control the fate of Chakas, Riser, and the rest of humanity, but of all sentient life across the galaxy....",

    "description": "The final novel of the Forerunner Saga trilogy by science-fiction legend Greg Bear - set in the Halo universe and based on the New York Times best-selling video game series! One hundred thousand years ago, Chaos rules the final days of the Forerunner empire. The Flood - a horrifying, shape-changing, and unstoppable parasite - has arrived in force, aided by unexpected allies, and internal strife has desperately weakened Forerunner defenses.  Facing the imminent collapse of their civilization, the Forerunners known as the Ur-Didact and the Librarian reveal what they know about the relationship between the long-vanished race of the Precursors and the Flood. While the Precursors created many technological species, including those of the Forerunners and humanity itself, the roots of the Flood may be found in an act of enormous barbarity, carried out beyond our galaxy 10 million years before. Because of that savagery, a greater evil looms.  Only the Ur-Didact and the Librarian - husband and wife pushed into desperate conflict - hold the keys to a solution. As they face the consequences of a mythic tragedy, one of them must now commit the greatest atrocity of all time - a shocking act designed to prevent an insane abomination from dominating the entire galaxy....",

    "description": "Nine years of tranquility came to an abrupt end when a Méridien starship entered the Hellébore system, sounding a dire warning for Alex Racine, the Haraken president. Unwanted visitors had arrived again. But this time, they're not alien; they're human.  Claiming to have followed the course of a colony ship launched a millennium ago when Earth wrestled with resource wars and climate change, the mission commander, Antonio García, requests a meeting with the planet's leaders. The Earthers profess a kinship with all humans, and their great desire is to have Méridien join their United Earth (UE).  Alex Racine journeys to Méridien to investigate and uncover the Earthers' intentions. In the Haraken world, SADEs (self-aware digital entities) have been freed from their boxes aboard the Méridien-built starships.

    "description": "Hank was a dying breed on the space station Belvaille. The criminal gangs that had once made their homes there were forced out by the corporations that had taken over since the facility became an Independent Protectorate. Instead of the gentlemanly gang wars that had once dominated the scene, and made Hank's services prized as a negotiator, the city was now plagued by the clash of corporate armies using heavy weapons. Even tanks roamed the streets regularly. Most everyone from the olden days had either fled the station or was killed due to the organizational changes. Changes that Hank personally brought about when he had negotiated Belvaille's status with the Navy.  As Hank contemplates whether he can survive in this increasingly hostile environment, he realizes that things aren't as bad as they seem - they are quite a bit worse. The constant power plays among corporations might have further reach than just the alleys of a backwater space station at the edge of the galaxy.",

As a species they are capable of “broadcast empathy”. Their acting skills are so powerful they are able to make people believe their portrayals are literally happening - even over remote transmission.

As the city modifies is resources to accommodate the new cash cow, Hank is hired to protect important actors by the city’s premier talent agent: his butler Cliston. But the good times don’t last as Damakans start getting murdered and whole productions are sabotaged and even outright attacked. The navy threatens to get involved as their favorite tele programs are interrupted and Garm, the Adjunct Over-watch of the city, enlists Hank to find the source of the violence and put an end to it. Hank fears his own betrothed is in danger as the city gets dragged into a gang war of which no one knows the cause.",

But their plans are somewhat interrupted when the galaxy’s premier assassin shows up and eliminates every single aristocrat. All except for one child who had been hidden. Hank is happy minding his own business. Of course, his business entails robbing, extorting, eating lots of food, and fighting. But compared with the rest of the criminals of his city, he’s practically a saint. However, Hank’s easy existence is interrupted by the chief of security who entrusts him with safeguarding the royal survivor. Along with his unsavory friends, Hank struggles to keep the last child alive while avoiding the navy, bounty hunters, organized crime, and the most successful assassin in history. If Hank fails, it will result in catastrophic economic collapse brought about by a vengeful empire.",

Hank makes do by working odd jobs, but he isn't sure how long those, or the city, can last.  However, there are still some people trying to scratch out a (dis)honest living on Belvaille. Hank concocts a plan to save the city: steal from the countless transports and freighters that pass through the System.  In the meantime, Hank falls in with a tough crowd of freedom fighters who seem determined to overthrow the government. The team goes on exceedingly dangerous assignments, with Hank taking the brunt of the danger.  As if things weren't bad enough, the Navy set up residence in the System, a powerful alien dignitary is scheduled to arrive, and Hank's absurdly-competent butler states that his robotic species may declare war on Hank's home.  It's up to Hank to fix the problems, find out who is doing what and why, and to try and earn a little cash in the process. ",

In his view the galaxy has given him a gift: a mutation that allows him to withstand great deals of physical trauma. He puts his abilities to the best use possible and that isn't by being a scientist.  Besides, the space station Belvaille doesn't need scientists. It is not, generally, a thinking person's locale. It is the remotest habitation in the entire Colmarian Confederation. There is literally no reason to be there.  Unless you are a criminal.  Because of its location, Belvaille is populated with nothing but crooks. Every day is a series of power struggles between the crime bosses.  Hank is an intrinsic part of this community as a premier gang negotiator. Not because he is eloquent or brilliant or an expert combatant, but because if you shoot him in the face he keeps on talking.  Hank believes he has it pretty good until a beautiful and mysterious blue woman enters his life with a compelling job offer.  Hank and Belvaille, so long out of public scrutiny, suddenly find themselves the epicenter of the galaxy with a lot of very unwelcome attention.",

    "description": "Belvaille has cemented its place as the most important system in the galaxy and Hank is working as an official Factotum, negotiating deals between gangs and noblemen under the watchful eye of the Arch Minister.  When his ever-capable butler, Cliston, is approached to become the General Manager of a Super Class glocken team, Hank is hired not only as protection, but as a player.  Hank finds himself thrown into the most grueling bloodsport in the galaxy and tasked with finding out how and why players are being abducted.  The friendly rivalries turn into full-scale conflict, and Hank unravels a far more insidious plot than the fixing of gambling results. In the process, Hank learns a lot about his history that he never even dreamed had existed.  Many of Hank's friends and enemies return in this action-packed and humorous take on the professional sporting world.  NOTE: Sequel to Hard Luck Hank: Screw the Galaxy, Hard Luck Hank: Basketful of Crap, Hard Luck Hank: Prince of Suck, and Hard Luck Hank: Suck My Cosmos ",

    "description": "Life is tough on space station Belvaille - not for the aristocratic nobles that call it home, but for the poor slobs like Hank.  Hank is considered a celebrated cutthroat and the oldest living person in the city. His occupation is to be hired muscle for those people who don't want to get their hands dirty but still want dirty things done. He possesses a mutation that allows him to be bulletproof and weigh thousands of pounds, two helpful traits in his line of work.  When the wife a city councilman approaches him about spying on her husband, Hank worries he's flying too close to the flames for safety. When the husband is assassinated, he's sure of it.  Hank has to keep himself from getting framed for the murder while he finds himself increasingly manipulated by powerful people as the machinations of the city council start to spill into his daily life.  Note: This is a sequel to Hard Luck Hank: Screw the Galaxy, Hard Luck Hank: Basketful of Crap, and Hard Luck Hank: Prince of Suck.",

    "description": "For all that Jason knows, life is amazing. But he's about to learn that all his new power, wealth, and influence comes at a price. Riding high on success, he and his team are looking to the future, preparing themselves for the challenges to come. Nothing, however, could have prepared him for the lessons his enemies have to teach. When magic is involved, the stakes can be even greater than life and death.  While Jason’s personal enemies make plans, the greater foes plaguing his new home have been pushed to the brink. With one powerful card left to play, they are on a collision course with Jason and his team. With no one to help and more than their lives on the line, Jason and his companions must fight with more monsters than ever in the race to grow stronger. With an invincible enemy already anticipating them, they will learn that sometimes winning the battle is more important than surviving it.  ",

With magic on the rise and forces pulling him in multiple directions, Jason is faced with challenges greater than ever before. Even as his power reaches new and incredible heights, he is faced with the realization that going beyond his best is still not enough.

With the authorities fulfilling their responsibilities (for once), he looks forward to some quiet time to rest and recuperate. The locals might not find ceaseless monster onslaughts and an interdimensional invasion relaxing, but Jason has had a rough few years. He's doing his best to let go of his anger. While his team is caught up in duty, Jason has no shortage of people looking to interfere with his rest. Enemies—old and new—are circling, and even would-be allies are trouble. A princess finds him inconveniently alive, an ancient king arrives at his barbecue, and the local Church of Fertility are uncomfortably enthusiastic about including him in their practices. As his friends strive to reach him from the far side of the world, they are all frustrated by obstacles. Jason is finally back in the world he longed for, but he is not the same man he was when he left. As the pressure on him mounts, allies and enemies alike will find that out the hard way.",

Despite warnings of danger that awaits him, he gets back in the saddle as an adventurer, ready to tackle new challenges. But as enemies that have lurked in the background start moving into the light, those challenges are not hard to find. Jason and his friends don’t wait passively; they use schemes of their own to take the fight to the enemy. His companions find themselves plunged into dangerous missions and confronted with enemies both personal and unexpected. Jason will push new boundaries, and while it comes at a cost, it will move him deeper into the realms of cosmic power.",

    "description": "With the Builder threat behind them, the time has finally come for Jason and his team to hit the road. Eager to get back to the adventuring he’s been longing for, Jason is excited to not be at the center of world-changing events. But before he goes, one last attempt to pull him into politics has him leaving Rimaros with a strong final impression. With new places to visit and new people to meet, the remnants of recent events have scarred the land and left lingering dangers behind. It's a busy time for adventurers willing and able to fight with monsters. Threats that once loomed in the background start coming to the fore, and the team prepares to join the fight. Their angelic new adversaries are patient, powerful, and remorseless, using such unconscionable strategies that mass slaughter is only the beginning. Jason is forced to confront that his growing power may give him more in common with his foes than his friends. While this opens a path to uncovering the methods and objectives of their enemies, it also brings him to their attention. To them, this makes him yet another tool to be used. But when conflict spills into epic battle, they'll be the latest to discover that challenging Jason Asano is a very bad idea.",

Cannell to craft a whodunit with buddy-cop charm and suspects aplenty - most of them in someone else's body.\" (<i>USA Today</i>) </p> <p>John Scalzi returns with <i>Head On</i>, the stand-alone follow-up to the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling and critically acclaimed <i>Lock In</i>. Chilling near-future SF with the thrills of a gritty cop procedural, <i>Head On</i> brings Scalzi's trademark snappy dialogue and technological speculation to the future world of sports. </p> <p>Hilketa is a frenetic and violent pastime where players attack each other with swords and hammers. The main goal of the game: obtain your opponent's head and carry it through the goalposts. With flesh and bone bodies, a sport like this would be impossible. But all the players are \"threeps\", robot-like bodies controlled by people with Haden's Syndrome, so anything goes. No one gets hurt, but the brutality is real, and the crowds love it. </p> <p>Until a star athlete drops dead on the playing field. </p> <p>Is it an accident or murder? FBI agents and Haden-related crime investigators Chris Shane and Leslie Vann are called in to uncover the truth - and in doing so travel to the darker side of the fast-growing sport of Hilketa, where fortunes are made or lost and where players and owners do whatever it takes to win, on and off the field. </p>",

First had been bandits, which actually proved to be fortuitous, with Ryann Cullin entering Sean’s service after that attack. The sudden harsh blizzard had been the worst trial they had to endure. Cold that even Sean couldn’t withstand had nearly stopped them in their tracks, but they managed to reach Flento.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the storm had passed, they were finally on their way to Hearthglen.

Now, they’ll take the war to the Golden.</b></p> <p>With new, more lethal weapons being added at every turn, the Forge goes into motion, advancing across the galactic arm in furious combat, leaving wreckage in the wake. But that wreckage has a purpose, and so does Dash. Until now, the war has been Golden allies throwing themselves in front of the Realm weapons, but that’s all about to change.</p> <p>When the Realm captures an alien ship, the pilot is not an enemy; it's an ally, if Dash can build a bond with the race known as the Rin-ti. Ancient enemies of the Golden, the Rin-ti have only one favor to ask: free their people from Golden control, and reduce the local Golden fleets to rubble.</p> <p>If Dash can do that, he’ll have everything he needs to build a fleet that can challenge the Golden in their own territory. But first, he’ll need to win, and to do so, he’ll need all hands on deck for a fight that will change history.</p>",

    "description": "Civil war looms in the Bobiverse in this brand-new, epic-length adventure by Audible number one best seller Dennis E. Taylor. More than a hundred years ago, Bender set out for the stars and was never heard from again. There has been no trace of him despite numerous searches by his clone-mates. Now Bob is determined to organize an expedition to learn Bender’s fate - whatever the cost. But nothing is ever simple in the Bobiverse. Bob’s descendants are out to the 24th generation now, and replicative drift has produced individuals who can barely be considered Bobs anymore. Some of them oppose Bob’s plan; others have plans of their own. The out-of-control moots are the least of the Bobiverse’s problems. Undaunted, Bob and his allies follow Bender’s trail. But what they discover out in deep space is so unexpected and so complex that it could either save the universe - or pose an existential threat the likes of which the Bobiverse has ever faced.  Heaven’s River is the fourth installment in the blockbuster Audible Original Bobiverse series - which has sold more than one million copies.",

Skippy was a bust-out drunk who could barely take care of himself. After being given a child he didn't want, he took out the anger he had on the child.</p> <p>If that wasn't enough for someone to deal with, things got worse for him. His one-time friends got tired of him, making him a target of their boredom and anger. This left the growing child with no safe haven—at school or home, someone was hurting him every day.</p> <p>Then, something miraculous happened: the Heavens stepped in, granting him a Sphere. Spontaneous manifestation of a Sphere was very rare, but it happened on occasion. Benedict, while being beaten unconscious and having his bones broken, was suddenly the Holder of a Sphere of Regeneration.</p> <p>A passerby broke up the attack on Benedict and got him whisked off to a clinic to see a Healer. The Healer not only found his newest injuries completely repaired, but also the long list of injuries Benedict had endured throughout his life. That examination turned up the fact that Benedict now had a Sphere and, as such, was bound for the Academy to learn how to deal with his new life.</p> <p>He was shown around by Agatha, his psychiatrist. She'd help him learn the things that his school had never told him about Holders. It was also on his first day that he'd met Atropos Rosaria Foxglove, his roommate, who had her own problems.</p> <p>He'd have to learn to coexist with a roommate who disliked him, all while trying to find his new place as a Holder of a Sphere. One of the few non-elite students, he would have an uphill climb. Benedict never backed down from a fight or pain, and he wasn't about to start now.</p>",

    "description": "The beginning of the end  A deadly swarm of earthquakes shakes the planet. In the sky above, the sun appears to stand still. While the world reels from the vast destruction, George Pierce and the Cerberus Group, a team of scientific and historical experts, uncover an imminent threat straight out of history that must be stopped. But not everyone wants them to succeed.  An apocalyptic death cult, made up of suicidal martyrs and true believers who will do whatever it takes to ensure the destruction of all life on Earth, goes head-to-head with a billionaire tech genius commanding an army of robots, on a quest to own the sun itself.  Caught in the middle, the Cerberus Group must fend off both sides while traveling to every corner of the map, and into the depths of myth and history, to find the holiest treasure on Earth - an artifact that can harness the power of creation. The prophecies are true.  The end is nigh.  Jeremy Robinson and Sean Ellis, the international best-selling team behind the Jack Sigler thrillers, including Cannibal and Empire, continue the new series that rewrites the way we see history. Rivaling the best of Matthew Reilly and James Rollins, Helios combines a blistering pace with fringe science and myths reborn.",

This next gig looks like more of the same…until Bex meets the client.<br /> <br /> Adrian Blackwood is a witch with a problem. His family has skirted the edges of King Gilgamesh’s ire for centuries, but thanks to a decision he made as a child, Adrian is personally responsible for putting his entire coven in Heaven’s crosshairs.<br /> <br /> Determined to set things right, Adrian drags his broom, caldron, and talking cat thousands of miles across the country to Seattle where he can fight the Eternal King’s warlocks without bringing the rest of his family into the fray. But witchcraft takes time, and if the warlocks catch him before his spells are ready, he’s dead. So Adrian does what any professional witch would do and hires a team of mercenaries to keep the warlocks off his back. He didn’t expect to get demons, but when you’re already on Heaven’s bad side, what’s a bit more fuel on the fire?<br /> <br /> Neither Adrian nor Bex knew what to expect when they signed their contract, but witch-plus-demon turns out to be a match made in the Hells. With this much chaos at their fingertips, even impossible dreams start to come back into reach, because Bex wasn’t always a mercenary. She used to be the Eternal King's biggest nightmare, and now that she’s got a witch in her corner, it’s time to show Adrian Blackwood just how much Hell he’s hired.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The hotly anticipated sequel to HELL FOR HIRE! One month ago, Bex, the demon Queen of Wrath, and Adrian, witch of the Blackwood, pulled off the upset victory of the century. Now, they find themselves facing the question all unexpected champions must answer: what next? </p> <p>They’ve declared war on Heaven, but how do you actually bring down a divinely powerful tyrant when your army’s still in the single digits and your magical fortress is an illegally modified Winnebago? It seems like a hopeless situation. As always, though, Adrian Blackwood has a plan, and this time, he’s going big. He’s got an idea to take down the Seattle Anchor, the giant magical fortress that houses the Anchor Market and every other bit of critical infrastructure that connects Heaven to Earth. </p> <p>How the Anchors work is a closely guarded secret, and getting to the good stuff will require going deep into the heart of Gilgamesh’s power. There’s a reason even the Queen of Wrath has never attacked one directly, but now that Adrian’s on her team, Bex thinks they can do it. She’s finally got the power she needs to actually move the needle on this war, and she’s going to hit that Anchor with all the fire she’s got. But the enemies of Heaven aren’t the only ones making plans. After the fiery return of his most persistent annoyance, Gilgamesh has ordered his princes to take care of the demon queen problem personally. It’s time to roll out the big guns and show these rebels what divine wrath really means, starting with the Hell of a Witch who made it all possible.</p> <p>-Book 2 of a new, action-packed Urban Fantasy series from the author of NICE DRAGONS FINISH LAST and MINIMUM-WAGE MAGIC!</p>",

For 3,000 years, the Herculean Society has preserved the legacy of the ancient hero, Hercules, protecting history's fragile relics from humanity, and humanity from the dangerous truths behind the legends. Now, the Society's new leader, archaeologist George Pierce, faces his first test: the Cerberus Group, a shadowy organization with two goals: the collection and distribution of black market relics, tech and secrets, and the purge of those deemed unfit for survival.  Pierce and his niece, Fiona - the last guardian of the \"mother tongue\", the forgotten language of creation - discover a secret entrance to the legendary Labyrinth, and at its heart, a hidden trove of relics that point the way to Hercules' greatest discovery: a mutagen that can rewrite the very code of life. When a surprise attack leaves Pierce and Fiona trapped in the deadly maze, fighting for their lives, the race to stop the Cerberus Group begins.  To defeat this new enemy, Pierce must assemble a team of experts including Felice Carter, a geneticist with a dangerous secret, Augustina Gallo, a mythology professor, Cintia Dourado, a high tech hacker, and Lazarus, a dead soldier returned to life.  Guided by their knowledge of science, history, and mythology, Pierce's team sets out on an epic journey, following in the footsteps of Hercules, to stop Cerberus from controlling the power that rises from the Well of Monsters.  ...or the world will be cleansed.  Jeremy Robinson and Sean Ellis, the international best-selling team behind the Jack Sigler thrillers, including Savage and Cannibal, return with a new series that rewrites the way we see history. Rivaling the best of Matthew Reilly and James Rollins, Herculean combines a blistering pace with fringe science and myths reborn. ",

But Fischer isn't like most MCs. In fact, he doesn't want to be a hero at all.</p> <p>Fame? Fortune? Power? He had enough of all that in his old life. Discovering forbidden fishing techniques and petting every cute animal that comes within scritching distance? Now <i>that's</i> a good time.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Fischer, cosmic forces rarely care for mortal feelings. He's hounded on all sides by inept cults, conspiring nobles, and more magical misunderstandings than those of a preteen relationship. Even his dutiful pet crab is firing energy blades like an anime antagonist.</p> <p>So grab your fishing rod and a good snack, and pet your dog for me. The catch of a lifetime awaits!</p> <p><b>The first volume of the laugh-out-loud LitRPG adventure series—a #1 Rising Star on Royal Road with over three million views—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>",

    "description": "Gabe thought he had covered all the angles, but it’s tough to plan a contingency for accidentally trapping an evil god in your brain.  Gabriel Delling might call himself a professional con artist, but when walking superstitions start trying to bite his face off, his charm is shockingly unhelpful. It turns out living nightmares almost never appreciate a good joke. Together with a succubus who insists on constantly saving his life, Gabe desperately tries to survive a new reality that suddenly features demons, legends, and a giant locust named Dale - all of whom pretty much hate his guts.  And when an ancient horror comes hunting for the spirit locked in his head, Gabe finds himself faced with the excruciating choice between death...or becoming some kind of freaking hero.  Hero Forged is the first book in the new series, Ethereal Earth, a modern fantasy adventure that challenges the natures of myth, humanity, and what it means to be the good guy.",

BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>;<i> Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.<br /> <br /> <b><i>Twas the night before Hogswatch and all through the house...something was missing.</i></b><br /> <br /> The stockings are hanging ready, the sherry and pies are waiting by the fireplace - but where is the jolly fat man with his sack? It's not right to find Death creeping down chimneys and trying to say 'Ho ho ho' - but someone's got to bring the little kiddies their presents. Or else they might stop believing. Belief is important in Discworld, particularly on the last night of the year when the time is turning. If the real man in the red suit isn't found by morning, there won't be a morning. Ever again...<br /> <br /> A festive feast of darkness, jolly robins and tinsel. As they say: '<i>You'd better watch out...'</i><br /> <br /> <b><i>Hogfather</i></b><i> is the fourth book in the Death series, but you can listen to the Discworld novels in any order.</i><br /> <br /> <i>The first book in the Discworld series - </i><b><i>The Colour of Magic</i></b><i> - was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.</i><br /> <br /> </p>",

That's where Ludo's wife is being held, but time is of the essence. If they don't hurry, she'll be sacrificed to the gods as part of some barbaric ceremony. With an army at their heels and a continent to cross, Terry and Ludo will need all the help they can get. Meanwhile, Mei Curie has opened a portal to another world...and it isn't what she expected. There are worms the size of cars, animals with bulletproof hides, and an advanced alien race unlike anything mankind has ever witnessed. Not to worry, though. Johnathan Finn has just the ticket: a rifle stocked with bullets, ready to deal with whatever threats come knocking. Along with his team of soldiers, John is here for a single purpose-to find his missing friend and bring him home-but in a world as strange as this one, a simple search and rescue mission could prove deadly.",

Each time, civilizations are ground to dust beneath the Demon King's hordes, but humanity has remained secure in the belief that a Hero of legend will always save them. There's just one slight problem. It's only been 23 years since the Demon King's latest rise, and this time, he's already conquered more than half the world. If humanity simply waits for the Hero's return, there may be no world left for him to save.</p> <p>And so, Yui Shaw sets out with an ambitious plan. A 10-step plan.</p> <p>She'll find a way to obtain the Hero's legendary sword. She'll earn obscure classes, gain levels, and increase her skills. She'll travel to the meticulously-crafted dungeons that seem designed for one specific Hero to complete. And, if she's truly (un)fortunate, she might even find a fairy.</p> <p>She might not be a Hero - but if she can fake it long enough, she might still be able to save the world.</p>",

World hunger is averted. Humanity flourishes. RC-714 is digested, absorbed…and passed on.</p> <p>The Change affects small fast-breeding mammals first. They multiply with the same aggressive speed as the ExoGen plants, but an insatiable hunger drives them to violence. A war between species breaks out. When RC-714 reaches humanity, along with every other large creature on the planet, civilization implodes. Every living thing that consumed the ExoGen crops begins to adapt to a world full of predators, accessing genes dating back to the beginning of life itself.</p> <p>Peter Crane and his son Jakob survive the Change, living in their family farmhouse and eating non-ExoGen food from a biodome, one of many provided by Ella Masse, who discovered the ramifications of her breakthrough too late. The pair ekes out a living in a world full of monsters, surviving until Ella shows up on their doorstep with her daughter, pursued by desperate predators and men alike.</p> <p>As the farmhouse falls under attack, Crane learns that the end of humanity, of life on Earth, can still be averted—if Ella Masse and her daughter survive and if they make it to the other side of the country without being captured…or consumed.</p> <p>Jeremy Robinson merges the science of Michael Crichton with the horror of Stephen King in this fresh take on the post-apocalypse, creating a true worst-case scenario for GMO crops that will have people reading labels before eating their next pepper, tomato, or kernel of corn.</p>",

    "description": "<p><b>In the sixth novel in the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling Iron Druid Chronicles, two-thousand-year-old Druid Atticus O’Sullivan finds himself the target of two goddesses of the hunt and a trickster god determined to unleash the apocalypse.<br /> </b><br /> <b>“[Kevin] Hearne is a terrific storyteller with a great snarky wit. . . . Neil Gaiman’s </b><b><i>American Gods</i></b><b> meets Jim Butcher’s Harry Dresden.”—</b><b><i>SFFWorld</i></b><br /> <br /> For someone who’s been alive for two thousand years, Atticus O’Sullivan is a pretty fast runner. Good thing, because he’s being chased by not one but two goddesses of the hunt—Artemis and Diana—for messing with one of their own. Dodging their slings and arrows, Atticus, Granuaile, and his wolfhound, Oberon, are making a mad dash across modern-day Europe to seek help from a friend of the Tuatha Dé Danann. His usual magical option of shifting planes is blocked, so instead of playing hide-and-seek, the game plan is . . . run like hell.<br /> <br /> Crashing the pantheon marathon is the Norse god Loki. Killing Atticus is the only loose end he needs to tie up before unleashing Ragnarok—AKA the Apocalypse. Atticus and Granuaile have to outfox the Olympians and contain the god of mischief if they want to go on living—and still have a world to live in.<b><br /> <br /> Don’t miss any of The Iron Druid Chronicles:</b><br /> <b>HOUNDED | HEXED | HAMMERED | TRICKED | TRAPPED | HUNTED | SHATTERED | STAKED | SCOURGED | BESIEGED</b></p>",

Joe and humanity as a whole messed up pretty badly, managing to get some of the most important people from both the Elven and Dwarven races killed. Now the war is escalating to unprecedented levels, and only one side needs to worry about being slain. With the attackers knowing they can get right back up after dying, they are throwing themselves against their centuries-long foe without caring for the consequences.  As the death toll rises, there’s still hope for Joe and the people that he chose to align himself with. His tiny Hamlet is hidden away from the Elves, so the Ritualist gets a quest to escort the core of the Dwarven Oligarchy to safety: their History, and those that lived it. If he can manage to save even a few as the Dwarven Oligarchy begins to Implode, the race might one day have a chance to regain their former glory.  There’s only one major issue with convincing the war-loving Dwarves to escape the final battle and hide away: they’re war-loving Dwarves.",

With Earth no longer habitable and the Mars colony slowly failing, they are humanity's best hope. </p> <p>After 10 years in a failed cryogenic bed - body asleep, mind awake - William Chanokh's torture comes to an end as the fog clears, the hatch opens, and his friend and fellow hacker, Tom, greets him...by stabbing a screwdriver into his heart. This is the first time William dies. </p> <p>It is not the last. </p> <p>When he wakes from death, William discovers that all but one crew member - Capria Dixon - is either dead at Tom's hands, or has escaped to the surface of Kepler 452b. This dire situation is made worse when Tom attacks again - and is killed. Driven mad by a rare reaction to extended cryo-sleep, Tom hacked the <i>Galahad</i>'s navigation system and locked the ship on a faster-than-light journey through the universe, destination: nowhere. Ever. </p> <p>Mysteriously immortal, William is taken on a journey with no end, where he encounters solitary desperation, strange and violent lifeforms, a forbidden love, and the nature of reality itself. </p> <p><b>...he discovers the infinite.</b> </p> <p><b>Jeremy Robinson, the master of fast-paced and highly original stories seamlessly blending elements of horror, science fiction, and thrillers, tackles his most ambitious subject matter to date: reality itself.

    "description": "Infinite2 is a bold continuation of Robinson’s best-selling science fiction novel, packed with mystery, action, and mind-bending twists.  Over a million books sold! William Chanokh is immortal...and he’s trapped on the Galahad, an interstellar starship on a never-ending journey through open space.  His only companions are Capria - mortal and in cryo-sleep - and Gal, an artificial intelligence, and the love of his life, with whom he spends every waking moment in the \"Great Escape\", a virtual paradise. After untold years living countless lives, Gal begins acting strange. Possessive. Violent. Paranoid.  Positive that something in the real world is causing her to malfunction, Will attempts to leave the Great Escape, but he finds himself a prisoner. Guided by a voice from reality, he is thrust into a series of torturous narratives, each one designed to break his will and keep him trapped in virtual reality.  Betrayed by his digital love, his long-term memory overwritten, and enduring violent manipulation, Will painfully peels back layers of simulation, fighting to reach reality 1.0 - where the nightmares are real. Maybe.  New York Times and number-one Audible best-selling author Jeremy Robinson takes listeners on a heart-wrenching journey to the edge of the universe and beyond, where distinguishing reality from simulation might be impossible.

The Zone he has landed on has been in a state of constant war for thousands of years, a tug of war between the Elven and Dwarven societies.

Though he is resistant, Joe reluctantly decides to go with the group he thinks will help him grow the most - and is instantly plunged into their bitter war.

    "description": "On the planet Tython, the ancient Je’daii order was founded. And at the feet of its wise Masters, Lanoree Brock learned the mysteries and methods of the Force - and found her calling as one of its most powerful disciples. But as strongly as the Force flowed within Lanoree and her parents, it remained absent in her brother, who grew to despise and shun the Je’daii, and whose training in its ancient ways ended in tragedy.  Now, from her solitary life as a Ranger keeping order across the galaxy, Lanoree has been summoned by the Je’daii Council on a matter of utmost urgency. The leader of a fanatical cult, obsessed with traveling beyond the reaches of known space, is bent on opening a cosmic gateway using dreaded dark matter as the key - risking a cataclysmic reaction that will consume the entire star system. But more shocking to Lanoree than even the prospect of total galactic annihilation, is the decision of her Je’daii Masters to task her with the mission of preventing it. Until a staggering revelation makes clear why she was chosen: The brilliant, dangerous madman she must track down and stop at any cost is the brother whose death she has long grieved - and whose life she must now fear.",

Between driving the elves out of dwarven sovereign territory, utterly destroying an army of thousands, and using resources he could have used for himself to bring back the fallen on his own side...his reputation begins to precede him once more. The human was so successful that many people even within the dwarven faction have decided that they need to step forward to stop him. Realizing that he’s been in the public eye too long, Joe decides that it’s time to step out of fighting the war and instead focus on completing new quest lines and consolidating power.

    "description": "Mark Hawkins, former park ranger and expert tracker, is out of his element, working onboard the Magellan, a research vessel studying the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. But his work is interrupted when, surrounded by 30 miles of refuse, the ship and its high-tech systems are plagued by a series of strange malfunctions and the crew is battered by a raging storm.  When the storm fades and the sun rises, the beaten crew awakens to find themselves anchored in the protective cove of a tropical island...and no one knows how they got there. Even worse, the ship has been sabotaged, two crewmen are dead, and a third is missing. Hawkins spots signs of the missing man onshore and leads a small team to bring him back. But they quickly discover evidence of a brutal history left behind by the island’s former occupants: Unit 731, Japan’s ruthless World War II human experimentation program. Mass graves and military fortifications dot the island, along with a decades-old laboratory housing the remains of hideous experiments.  As more crew members start to disappear, Hawkins realizes that they are not alone. In fact, he suspects they were brought to this strange and horrible island. The crew is taken one by one, and while Hawkins fights to save his friends, he learns the horrible truths: Island 731 was never decommissioned and the person taking his crewmates may not be a person at all - not anymore.",

    "description": "<p>It’s amazing what the lack of immediate threat to one’s life and wellbeing can do for a person’s disposition. High risk, high reward endeavors suddenly seem far less appealing, month-long delays are no longer a cause for concern, and sleeping in every single day of the week becomes an extremely attractive proposition. Indeed, without a pressing need to aggressively expand its power, Boxxy T. Morningwood is finally able to simply sit back, enjoy life, and watch the world both turn and burn. Questions such as \"Who started those fires?\" and \"Should I do something about them?\" are answered with \"Don’t know\" and \"Don’t care.\" Having finally achieved the slow life it never knew it wanted, Boxxy is quite unwilling to jeopardize its newfound safety for no good reason.<br /> <br /> Of course, old habits die hard. Acquiring things of the tasty and/or shiny variety remain an enticing goal, as does the steady accumulation of power. Just because it no longer has the threat of death looming over it doesn’t mean that the once-mimic won’t take the occasional calculated risk in exchange for immense personal gain. Admittedly, developments outside its predictions will inevitably put carefully laid plans to waste, but that’s how it always has been and always will be. Boxxy will deal with those issues in the same manner it always has–with cunning ingenuity, brutal efficiency, and old-fashioned dumb luck. Despite what one might think, all three of those traits can be nurtured and improved, even something as seemingly unreliable as good fortune. <i>Especially</i> good fortune.<br /> <br /> The time for the Hero of Chaos to get thrown about by the whims of fate is over, and it is now Boxxy’s turn to make the world bend to its will, starting with the savage orcs of the far south.</p>",

Without authority, a King is only a tyrant.</b></p> <p>Damien Montgomery serves the Mage-King of Mars as a Hand: a troubleshooter, judge, and roving representative. Now, his duties have brought him home and into conflict with his fellows.</p> <p>A Hand is dead in nuclear fire amongst the mountains of Mars. The conspiracy she served is broken and scattered, but Damien must know who they are and what drove them. What secrets could convince a Hand of the Mage-King to betray everything?</p> <p>But even as Damien hunts the surviving conspirators, it is clear that someone else is hunting them—someone with no interest in prisoners or secrets.</p> <p>Worse, the Council of the Protectorate, the single check on the power of the Mage-King and his Hands, has questions. They have the right to demand his answers, but the questioning quickly proves a kangaroo court.</p> <p>To serve the Protectorate, Damien must find the people who betrayed him—and decide just what he is prepared to sacrifice to preserve all he is sworn to defend!</p> <p><i>In celebration of the tenth anniversary of the first Starship's Mage novel, Glynn Stewart is proud to bring you this new revised edition. Please note that while this edition has been edited and revised for clarity, the story and events remain the same.</i></p>",

    "description": "To save mankind...they must raise the gods. Several months after his neighborhood was cloaked in darkness and invaded by the demon-like denizens of a hellish world, life has returned to normal for Miah Gray, a.k.a. Laser Chicken. No longer burdened by PTSD, he is free to enjoy his family and to help pick up the pieces of a pillaged world. At night, he trains with his eight-year-old companion, Bree, a.k.a. Demon Dog, and their neighbors Henry and Sarah, the god-like descendants of Helen of Sparta and the mythological Zeus. All is calm...until new neighbors move in across the street and shatter the peace. Jonas, a.k.a. Mind Bullet, a telekinetic assassin, and his artificial intelligence, Bubbles, are pursued by strange and powerful enemies. The neighborhood is rocked by sudden violence, but the unlikely heroes band together to save the residents once more. However, their victory is short-lived when it’s interrupted by the appearance of a superhuman figure who has been influencing their lives for years—Linda, a.k.a. Zeus. In classic mythology fashion, Zeus, supreme god of Olympus, sends them on an urgent quest: descend into the underworld; travel through the realm between worlds, Khaos; face whatever trials await; find the gate to Tartarus; and summon the gods and Titans residing there to war. A grave evil is coming, and only Earth’s oldest and most powerful heroes can stop it. With his unique brand of madness, New York Times and #1 Audible bestseller Jeremy Robinson descends into the underworld and puts a new spin on Greek mythology. Laying the final puzzle piece for the Infinite Timeline, Khaos is an epic crossover novel that is equal parts character, myth, humor, and poetic action.",

    "description": "<p>It would appear that, after two years of relative slacking, the Hero of Chaos is once again facing an ever-growing workload. Boxxy had been quite fortunate to obtain an exceptionally potent pawn with very little effort, but that was still effort it did not intend to expend. Sensing it might get dragged into things it really doesn't want to bother with, the creature makes haste to depart Velos and its orcs so that it may continue its private preparations for the upcoming Dragon Festival. Of course, it's never that easy. First, it has to make good on a deal it made to babysit not one, not two, but three spoiled brats. Normally it would just refuse, or at the very least just lock them up in a dungeon somewhere. Unfortunately, neither of those are attractive options when this job involves the deceitful shapeshifter's natural enemy—the Holy Inquisition of the Goddess of Truth and Justice, headed by Teresa's latest chosen Hero, Sigmund Law.</p> <p>Boxxy really doesn't want to deal with any of that. It's got treasure to plunder, Levels to grind, and a bottomless pit of a belly to fill, to name a few things on its agenda. Aside from having better things to do, the very idea of this bothersome chore runs contrary to its monstrous instincts, not to mention it's absolutely nonsensical. What sort of weirdo thinks a wolf in sheep's clothing is the best candidate to look after three little pigs? The God of Uncertainty, that's who. It's a rare order from the big kettle himself, and Boxxy must comply or find itself stripped of the divine gifts that are vital to maintaining its public image. Between suffering through this inane task for the time being or watching its nation-spanning web of lies unravel, the choice is obvious. So, for better or worse, the industrious box gets busy figuring out how to squeeze 'babysitting' into its schedule.</p> <p>Only to have those plans instantly shatter when it returns home to find the place in ruins.</p>",

    "description": "From a New York Times best-selling and Hugo award-winning author comes a modern masterwork of science fiction, introducing a captain, his crew, and a detective as they unravel a horrifying solar system wide conspiracy that begins with a single missing girl.  Humanity has colonized the solar system - Mars, the Moon, the Asteroid Belt and beyond - but the stars are still out of our reach. Jim Holden is XO of an ice miner making runs from the rings of Saturn to the mining stations of the Belt. When he and his crew stumble upon a derelict ship, the Scopuli, they find themselves in possession of a secret they never wanted. A secret that someone is willing to kill for - and kill on a scale unfathomable to Jim and his crew. War is brewing in the system unless he can find out who left the ship and why. Detective Miller is looking for a girl. One girl in a system of billions, but her parents have money and money talks. When the trail leads him to the Scopuli and rebel sympathizer Holden, he realizes that this girl may be the key to everything. Holden and Miller must thread the needle between the Earth government, the Outer Planet revolutionaries, and secretive corporations - and the odds are against them. But out in the Belt, the rules are different, and one small ship can change the fate of the Universe.

    "description": "The saga of the Rêveur continues in this second novel in the Silver Ships series.  The surviving Méridiens have returned to Confederation space, aided by their recently discovered cousins, the New Terrans. They expect a celebration after their 71-year absence. Instead, they're shocked to find the silver ships have destroyed half the Confederation.  The Méridiens are fleeing in advance of the horde of alien ships. But Alex Racine and his crew didn't come this far to run away from humanity's enemy. They intend to hunt the silver ships. But, to succeed, they need help. Renée de Guirnon, the leader of the Rêveur's Méridiens, reveals a sordid secret of Méridien society: Citizens who defy their House, for any reason, are stripped of their rights, declared \"Independents\", and imprisoned on the planet Libre. But the Independents aren't everyone's pariahs, especially if you're Alex Racine and you're looking for allies against the silver ships. An entire colony of independent, free-thinking radicals offers just the sort of people Alex wants on his side, so an alliance is struck. Soon the enemy ships will swarm off the planet Bellamonde, and the race begins for Alex and the Librans. The planet must be evacuated and the military force readied before the silver ships attack. Alex knows a battle is coming, but will they have enough time to prepare? ",

    "description": "<p>Having survived the first wave of invading players, Oren now seeks to strengthen his clan. With the Breeder's Den destroyed and most of Goblin's Gorge's resources devoted to rebuilding, his best hope lies in creating an army of golems. But for that, he needs Viridium, a rare metal that can only be obtained from hobgoblin towns, where Oren and his clan of goblins are viewed as nothing more than potential slaves. To make his way in the game, and to defeat his former guild, Oren's ingenuity alone will not be enough. He will need to conquer his deepest fears and tap into his inner monster. </p> <p>The Soundbooth Theater team for this production: </p> <p>Jeff Hays - Narration, Music, Sound Design </p> <p>Laurie Catherine Winkel - Raystia, Yulli </p> <p>Annie Ellicott - Misa, Lolo, Duladeen </p> <p>Dalton Lynne - Proofing, Editing </p> <p>Ahmed Mahmoud - Production, Editing, Mastering, Music, Sound Design</p>",

Most who get sick experience nothing worse than flu, fever, and headaches. But for the unlucky one percent - and nearly five million souls in the United States alone - the disease causes \"Lock In\": Victims fully awake and aware, but unable to move or respond to stimulus. The disease affects young, old, rich, poor, people of every color and creed. The world changes to meet the challenge. </p> <p>A quarter of a century later, in a world shaped by what's now known as \"Haden's syndrome\", rookie FBI agent Chris Shane is paired with veteran agent Leslie Vann. The two of them are assigned what appears to be a Haden-related murder at the Watergate Hotel, with a suspect who is an \"integrator\" - someone who can let the locked in borrow their bodies for a time. If the Integrator was carrying a Haden client, then naming the suspect for the murder becomes that much more complicated. </p> <p>But \"complicated\" doesn't begin to describe it. As Shane and Vann began to unravel the threads of the murder, it becomes clear that the real mystery - and the real crime - is bigger than anyone could have imagined. </p> <p><b>BONUS AUDIO</b>: Audible's audio edition of <i>Lock In</i> contains the bonus novella, <i>Unlocked: An Oral History of Haden's Syndrome</i>, written by John Scalzi and narrated by a full cast.</p>",

    "description": "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin.</b><br /> <br /> <b>Over 1 million Discworld audiobooks sold – discover the extraordinary universe of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld like never before</b><br /> <br /> The audiobook of <i>Lords and Ladies</i> is narrated by Indira Varma (<i>Game of Thrones</i>; <i>Luther</i>; <i>This Way Up</i>). BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>;<i> Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.<br /> <br /> <b>'</b><b><i>People didn't seem to be able to remember what it was like with the elves around. Life was certainly more interesting then, but usually because it was shorter. And it was more colourful, if you liked the colour of blood . . .</i></b><b>'</b><br /> <br /> On Midsummer Night, dreams are especially powerful. So powerful, in fact, that they can cause the walls between realities to come crashing down. And some things you <i>really</i> don't want to break through.<br /> <br /> The witches Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick return home to discover that elves have invaded Lancre. And even in a world of wizards, trolls, dwarfs, Morris dancers - and the odd orangutan - they're spectacularly nasty creatures.<br /> <br /> The fairies are back - and this time they don't just want your teeth...<br /> <br /> <b>'His spectacular inventiveness makes the Discworld series one of the perennial joys of modern fiction' </b><b><i>Mail on Sunday</i></b><b><br /> <br /> 'Cracking dialogue, compelling illogic and unchained whimsy' </b><b><i>The Sunday Times</i></b><b><br /> <br /> </b><b><i>Lords and Ladies </i></b><i>is the fourth book in the Witches series, but you can listen to the Discworld novels in any order.</i><br /> <br /> <i>The first book in the Discworld series - </i><b><i>The Colour of Magic</i></b><i> - was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.</i><br /> <br /> </p>",

He and his growing family had just moved into a new home and hired on new staff for day-to-day matters. All he wanted to do was craft and love his wives, and it seemed like the peaceful life he hoped for might be within his reach.&nbsp;</p><p>Denmur and Lord Sharpeyes would not let that happen. Using their connections, they put into motion a chain of events that would reverberate across the city of Hearthglen. Sean was called to attend the Lord’s party - he came, bringing all of his family and friends with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Both sides were surprised by events as they unfolded, and it quickly became apparent that conflict would not be denied. With the Einherjar, a Valkyrie, and an old foe, Velin Dykstra, backing them up, Evan Sharpeyes and Klein Denmur challenged Sean to trial by combat.&nbsp;</p><p>Exhausted and with depleted energy, Sean still led his wives onto the field of battle. The fight was bloody and taxing, but in the end, Sean struck down Evan Sharpeyes before collapsing. With his eyesight fading, Sean looked at his wives, but only saw a few female-like figures rushing toward him. The last sound he heard was a great many wings converging on him, and his mind drifted to thoughts of Morrigan....&nbsp;</p><p>Word of Sean’s victory spread throughout the city, but none could say whether he had survived to enjoy it.&nbsp;</p><p>(This work contains adult situations that some might find offensive, the least of which is graphic sex. This book is about an Overpowered MC, and contains a harem. You’ve been warned.)</p>",

Luckily, an alien named Crish arrived to help Zander adjust to his new reality.</p> <p>His first few days were a chaotic mess as he tried to adapt, but it was his first day on board the ship <i>Fractured Dreams</i> that Zander discovered what his new life would be. He was one of the lucky one-in-ten-thousand: a person whose body accepted an AI of Antecedent technology. His AI, however, was special, taking on the memories and persona of his former lover, Selda Engel.</p> <p>With Crish's and AI Selda's help, Zander came up with a mad plan to displace the pilot leader, Shivatin the Rakshasa, and take over that position. He had experience staying alive as a mercenary and used that to forge the fractured crew into a cohesive new whole.</p> <p>As he was finally taking on the mantle of leader, Shivatin led a mutiny to take the ship from the captain and to kill Zander. The Rakshasa had no clue what he'd unleashed in doing so; Zander led his new team in a repelling action, killing the invading boarders, then pushing on to the bridge to take out Shivatin.</p> <p>Veldiami, the captain of <i>Fractured Dreams</i>, took it one step further, boarding the other ship that helped in the mutiny to claim as salvage. It only took killing four—including the ship's captain—to secure it as loot.</p> <p>Left on the other ship, the <i>Righteous</i>, to guide it to the nearest galactic hub, Zander made a deal with the remaining crew. They used the FTL drive to reach the hub that day, meaning Zander would find himself alone on MX Hub for two days before <i>Fractured Dreams</i> and her crew arrived.</p> <p>What trouble could a human—completely out of his depth in a new universe <i>and </i>on an alien space station—get into before his crewmates arrived?</p>",

    "description": "<p>Nearly everything in Gregory’s life had changed by the end of his first year at the academy. Alone at the start of his novice year, he’d gotten engaged to Yukiko Warlin and found a friend in Jenn Bean by the time the annual tournament was over. </p> <p>The three of them went on to join Aether’s Guard, bringing the name of the nearly dead clan back to life. Elder Lightshield, the leader of Aether’s Guard, gave them his support and backing and Magus Dia guided them. Their training with Armsmaster Gin continued, offering a safe haven and helping to shield them from the worst tribulations that academy life could bring. </p> <p>Nothing is perfect, though. Gregory, Yukiko, and Jenn had also made enemies, and faced resentment and anger from the Eternal Flame clan more than once. Weathering the troubles that Nick Shun and his friends tried to bring down on them, the three magi rose to ever greater heights. </p> <p>Gregory’s second tournament included the unexpected, but welcome, arrival of Carmichael Pettit, as well as a mysterious bet between Jenn and Yukiko. At the end of the tournament, Jenn had bested Yukiko and Gregory, and the three of them held three of the top four places. </p> <p>With both of their families in attendance, Gregory and Yukiko wed after the tournament. The newlywed couple would face the academy and the world as one, and with their friends and their clan, they would strive to be at the pinnacle of their class once more. </p> <p>This book contains some adult themes.</p>",

Instead of saving the day, we accidentally wiped out a quarter of the Milky Way.</p> <p>Now, here I am, Crystal Genocide, in a bit of a pickle. I've landed on this bizarre planet, surrounded by odd monsters and folks who have magic that feels way too familiar. It's like they're copying our style, but not quite getting it right. My mission? Unravel this magic mystery, track down my magical girl gang, and maybe, just maybe, put back together the pieces of our home that we kinda, sorta blew up. Hopefully, I won't accidentally destroy this world too! Wish me luck!</p>",

    "description": "The Ankh-Morpork Post Office is running like...well, not at all like a government office. The mail is delivered promptly; meetings start and end on time; five out of six letters relegated to the Blind Letter Office ultimately wend their way to the correct addresses. Postmaster General Moist von Lipwig, former arch-swindler and confidence man, has exceeded all expectations: including his own. So it's somewhat disconcerting when Lord Vetinari summons Moist to the palace and asks, \"Tell me, Mr. Lipwig, would you like to make some real money?\" <p>Vetinari isn't talking about wages, of course. He's referring, rather, to the Royal Mint of Ankh-Morpork, a venerable institution that has run for centuries on the hereditary employment of the Men of the Sheds and their loyal outworkers, who do make money in their spare time. Unfortunately, it costs more than a penny to make a penny, so the whole process seems somewhat counterintuitive.</p> <p>Next door, at the Royal Bank, the Glooper, an \"analogy machine\", has scientifically established that one never has quite as much money at the end of the week as one thinks one should, and the bank's chairman, one elderly Topsy (née Turvy) Lavish, keeps two loaded crossbows at her desk. Oh, and the chief clerk is probably a vampire.</p> <p>But before Moist has time to fully consider Vetinari's question, fate answers it for him. Now he's not only making money, but enemies too; he's got to spring a prisoner from jail, break into his own bank vault, stop the new manager from licking his face, and, above all, find out where all the gold has gone: otherwise, his life in banking, while very exciting, is going to be really, really short.</p>",

What could be cooler than an inquisitor on the run for a crime he didn't commit? Not much. How much is Eisenhorn willing to compromise himself – and his closest friends – and risk his soul for a chance to clear his name?</p> <p><i>The Story:</i></p> <p>A century after his recovery of the alien Necroteuch, Gregor Eisenhorn is one of the Imperial Inquisition's most celebrated agents. But when a face from his past returns to haunt him, and he is implicated in a great tragedy that devastates the world of Thracian Primaris, Eisenhorn's universe crumbles around him. The daemon Cherubael is back, and seeks to bring the inquisitor to ruin - either by his death, or by turning him to the service of the Dark Gods.</p>",

BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>;<i> Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.<br /> <br /> <b><i>'There's a kind of magic in masks. Masks conceal one face, but they reveal another. The one that only comes out in darkness....'</i></b><br /> <br /> The Opera House in Ankh-Morpork is home to music, theatrics and a harmless masked Ghost who lurks behind the scenes. But now a set of mysterious backstage murders may just stop the show.<br /> <br /> Agnes Nitt has left her rural home of Lancre in the hopes of launching a successful singing career in the big city. The only problem is, she doesn't quite look the part. And there are two witches who would much rather she return home to join their coven.<br /> <br /> Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg have travelled to Ankh-Morpork to convince Agnes that life as a witch is much better than one on the stage. Only now they're caught up in a murder mystery featuring masks and maniacal laughter.<br /> <br /> And the show MUST go on . . .<br /> <br /> <b>'Funny, delightfully inventive, and refuses to lie down in its genre' </b><b><i>Observer</i></b><br /> <br /> <b><i>Maskerade </i></b><i>is the fifth book in the Witches series, but you can listen to the Discworld novels in any order.</i><br /> <br /> <i>The first book in the Discworld series - </i><b><i>The Colour of Magic</i></b><i> - was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.</i><br /> <br /> </p>",

    "description": "Damon has become a monster...sort of. Betrayed and left for dead by a group of slaving nobles, he thought there was nothing left but to bleed out as he counted the number of bricks on the ceiling. But fate had other plans. Moments before Damon's death, a gelatinous, gluttonous mimic reveals itself to him. Fearing a more gruesome and horrible death down the mimic’s gullet, Damon offers the food in his pack—sandwiches, cookies, and everything else! Encouraged by the (admittedly forced) generosity, the Mimic fuses with Damon, enhancing his body and transforming him into a half-man half-mimic monstrosity. Once a poor, down-on-his-luck scout, Damon now has new capabilities far beyond anything anyone on Basania has seen before. The only problem? His new bodymate’s insatiable hunger for cake...and human flesh.",

Bray. Jonas kills people...with his mind. He reaches out, focuses for a moment, and feels a snap of pain between his eyes. Then his target falls over dead: a hole in the center of their brains. The cause of death is unknown to all aside from Jonas, and his lone companion, Bubbles, a sarcastic AI with aspirations to be more human, or a serial killer. One of the two. Maybe both. Jonas calls his ability...mind bullet. Sensing Jonas is lonely and depressed, Bubbles arranges for Madee, a Thai delivery woman by day and a thief by night, to enter his life. For a moment there are sparks. But chaos follows as the people Madee last robbed catch up to her. They also happen to be the Shrieking Ninjas. After surviving the assault, Jonas and Madee find themselves on the run with a $10 million hit called on Jonas. Killers from all over the globe pursue the pair as they run for their lives, headlong into Jonas’ mysterious past, uncovering the surreal origins and extent of his abilities. They discover a dark and twisted history that threatens to unravel his mind and leave him susceptible to control. Working with Bubbles, Madee, and a growing list of new allies, Jonas battles his way through waves of assassins, some with abilities like his, all to protect the world from a recently discovered, untraceable weapon of mass destruction - himself.",

    "description": "<p>Crazy has no memory and feels no fear. Dangerous and unpredictable, he's locked away in SafeHaven, a psychiatric hospital, where he spends the long days watching <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> and wondering what the outside world smells like. When a mysterious visitor arrives and offers him a way out Crazy doesn't hesitate to accept. </p> <p>But outside the hospital Crazy is faced with a world on the brink of nuclear annihilation, and finds himself relocated to Neuro Inc., a secretive corporation with strange government ties. When he discovers evidence of human experimentation he escapes with a syringe, the contents of which are unknown to him but precious to Neuro. Cornered and with a complete disregard for the results, Crazy makes himself indispensable by injecting the substance into his leg. </p> <p>As the substance enters his bloodstream, though, his eyes are opened to a world beyond human experience, where fear is a tool and the shadows hide the source of mankind's nightmares. Struggling to understand his new abilities, Crazy allies himself with the company he fled and begins peeling back the layers of his past, the brewing war between worlds, how he can stop it - and what he did to start it. </p> <p>With <i>Mirrorworld</i>, Robinson, whose trademarked pacing and inventive plots have been highly praised by bestselling authors like Jonathan Maberry, Scott Sigler, and James Rollins, treats listeners to a wildly imaginative, frenetically paced thriller exploring the origins of fear.</p>",

    "description": "New entry in the best-selling Monster Hunter International series by Dragon Award-winning authors Larry Correia and Sarah A. Hoyt  When Owen Pitt and the rest of the Monster Hunter International crew are called away to mount a month’s-long rescue mission in a monster-infested nightmare dimension, Julie Shackleford - Owen’s wife and descendant of MHI founder Bubba Shackleford - is left behind. Her task: hold down the fort and take care of her new baby son Ray. Julie’s devoted to the little guy, but the slow pace of office work and maternity leave are starting to get to her. But when a routine field call brings her face-to-face with an unspeakable evil calling itself Brother Death, she’ll get more excitement than she ever hoped for.  Julie is the Guardian of a powerful ancient artifact known as the Kamaresh Yar, and Brother Death wants it. In the wrong hands, it could destroy reality as we know it. Julie would die before giving it up.  Then Ray goes missing, taken by Brother Death. The price for his safe return: the Kamaresh Yar. If Julie doesn’t hand over the artifact it means death - or worse - for baby Ray. With no other choice left to her, Julie agrees to Brother Death’s demands. But when you’re dealing with an ancient evil, the devil is in the details.  To reclaim her son, Julie Shackleford will have to fight her way through necromantic death cults, child-stealing monsters, and worse. And she’ll have to do it all before Brother Death can unleash the Kamaresh Yar.  It’s one woman against an army of monsters. But Julie Shackleford is no ordinary woman - she’s one tough mother!",

It turns out that monsters are real. All the things from myth, legend, and B-movies are out there, waiting in the shadows. Officially secret, some of them are evil, and some are just hungry. On the other side are the people who kill monsters for a living. Monster Hunter International is the premier eradication company in the business. And now Owen is their newest recruit.  It's actually a pretty sweet gig, except for one little problem. An ancient entity known as the Cursed One has returned to settle a centuries-old vendetta. Should the Cursed One succeed, it means the end of the world, and MHI is the only thing standing in his way.  With the clock ticking towards Armageddon, Owen finds himself trapped between legions of undead minions, belligerent federal agents, a cryptic ghost who has taken up residence inside his head, and the cursed family of the woman he loves. Business is good.... Welcome to Monster Hunter International. ",

When hunters from around the world gather in Las Vegas for a conference, a creature left over from a World War Two weapons experiment wakes up and goes on a rampage across the desert. A not-so-friendly wager between the rival companies turns into a race to see who can bag the mysterious creature first. Only there is far more to this particular case than meets the eye, and as Hunters fall prey to their worst nightmares, Owen Zastava Pitt and the staff of Monster Hunter International have to stop an ancient god from turning Sin City into a literal hell on earth.

When Monster Hunter International's top hunter, Owen Zastava Pitt, was given a tip about some hunters who had gone missing in action, he didn't realize their rescue mission would snowball into the single biggest operation in MHI's history. Their men are being held prisoner in a horrific nightmare dimension, and the only way to reach them is through the radioactive ruins of a monster-infested war zone.  As if that wasn't bad enough, it's also the home base of the powerful creature behind the devastating attacks on the Last Dragon and Copper Lake. It turns out ancient gods of chaos really hate trespassers. But this god picked a fight with the wrong crew, and now MHI wants payback. Calling on their allies, a massive expedition is formed, and with the odds stacked against them, a legion of hunters goes to war.  It's D-Day at the City of Monsters. ",

Now an evil death cult known as the Church of the Temporary Mortal Condition wants to capture Owen in order to gain the favor of the great Old Ones. The Condition is led by a fanatical necromancer known as the Shadow Man. The government wants to capture the Shadow Man and has assigned the enigmatic Agent Franks to be Owen's full-time bodyguard, which is a polite way of saying that Owen is monster bait.  With supernatural assassins targeting his family, a spy in their midst, and horrific beasties lurking around every corner, Owen and the staff of Monster Hunter International don't need to go hunting, because this time the monsters are hunting them. Fortunately, this bait is armed and very dangerous.",

And, to no one's great surprise, the conflict centers around the small, insufferably arrogant, strictly fundamentalist duchy of Borogravia, which has long prided itself on its ability to beat up on its neighbors. This time, however, it's Borogravia that's getting its long-overdue comeuppance, which has left the country severely drained of young men. <p>Ever since her brother Paul marched off to battle a year ago, Polly Perks has been running The Duchess, her family's inn, even though the revered national deity, Nuggan, has decreed that female ownership of a business is an Abomination. To keep The Duchess in the family, Polly must find her missing sibling. So she cuts off her hair, dons masculine garb, and sets out to join him in this man's army.</p> <p>Polly is afraid that someone will see through her disguise; a fear that proves groundless when the legendary Sergeant Jackrum accepts her without question. Or perhaps the sergeant is too desperate to discriminate, which would explain why a vampire, a troll, a zombie, a religious fanatic, and two uncommonly close \"friends\" are also eagerly welcomed into the fighting fold. Soon, Polly finds herself wondering about the myriad peculiarities of her new brothers-in-arms. It would appear that Polly \"Ozzer\" Perks is not the only grunt with a secret.</p>",

War with the Empire to the south is imminent, and there's talk of the city's adventurers being drafted into the campaign. Though this conflict seems inevitable and promises to be horrific, the common folk can do little but act like there's nothing wrong. Rather than lose sleep over something so wildly out of their control, they instead worry about tiny, personal, inconsequential issues. Things like, \"Will the butcher have fresh steak today?\" and, \"Should I get those new boots now, or wait and see if they go on sale?\"</p> <p>However, though they try to maintain some modicum of normalcy, the people of Azurvale have yet to find out that their capital is already under threat. Not by some warmongering nation, but by a certain individual that has come to them seeking asylum, knowledge, profit, and power through any means necessary. As this newcomer burrows into the city's underbelly like a voracious tick, it cares not for the people it hurts along the way. Indeed, any soul unfortunate enough to cross paths with Boxxy T. Morningwood seems doomed to have their life ruined in one way or another. Often through no fault of their own.</p> <p>Whether it's an ancient being, a skilled assassin, a godlike archer, or a fresh-faced recruit, none shall be spared from the whims of chaos.</p> <p>Content warning: Profanity, gore, violence, explicit adult content.</p> <p>The Soundbooth Theater Team for this production:</p> <ul> <li>Jeff Hays - narration, sound design</li> <li>Annie Ellicott - Keira, Rowana, the Dryads, and the rest of the new female cast </li> <li>Dalton Lynne - editing and proofing</li> <li>Ahmed Mahmoud - editing, music, sound design, and mastering</li> </ul>",

BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.<br /> <br /> <b>'YOU CANNOT INTERFERE WITH FATE. WHO ARE YOU TO JUDGE WHO SHOULD LIVE AND WHO SHOULD DIE?'</b><br /> <br /> Death comes to us all. When he came to Mort, he offered him a job.<br /> <br /> Death is the Grim Reaper of the Discworld, a black-robed skeleton with a scythe who ushers souls into the next world. He is also fond of cats and endlessly baffled by humanity. Soon Death is yearning to experience what humanity really has to offer, but to do that, he'll need to hire some help.<br /> It's an offer Mort can't refuse. As Death's apprentice he'll have free board, use of the company horse-and being dead isn't compulsory. It's a dream job-until Mort falls in love with Death's daughter, Ysabell, and discovers that your boss can be a killer on your love life...<br /> <br /> The Discworld novels can be enjoyed in any order, but <i>Mort</i> is the first book in the Death series.<br /> <br /> The first book in the Discworld series - <i>The Colour of Magic </i>- was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.<br /> <br /> </p>",

    "description": "<p>Armageddon Day. That is how history will remember the date when two Overlords clashed amidst the war-torn streets of New Whitehall. The disastrous duel its explosive conclusion wreaked heavy casualties on the two armies present, rendering both the Ishigar Republic and the Lodrak Empire unable to continue to fight. And yet, it was no stalemate. With one Hero defeated and another revealed, the balance of power is sure to shift in the elvish nation’s favor. The Republic’s leaders will surely not hesitate to seize this opportunity, as they had already paid for it in blood and gold. Meanwhile the Lodrak Empire is gripped by unease overnight as their Goddess mysteriously falls silent. </p> <p>Boxxy doesn’t care about any of that at the moment. Mostly because the confrontation with Teresa has left it in a comatose state at a most inopportune time. With the Hero status of its public persona revealed, it will be forced to rapidly adapt and escalate its plans. Whereas before it only had to worry about keeping its true identity a secret, it will now have to worry about its alter ego being targeted. Each chosen of the divines is a controversial figure, and the suddenly revealed Hero of Chaos will surely attract a lot of attention. </p> <p>And, as the shapeshifter’s primal instincts are well aware, too much attention can and will lead to a surprise meeting with Death itself. </p> <p>Content Warning: Profanity, gore, violence, explicit adult content.</p>",

A teenage mage of humble birth and slightly above-average skill, Zorian is attending his third year of education at Cyoria's magical academy. A driven and quiet young man, he is consumed by a desire to ensure his own future and free himself of the influence of his family, resenting the Kazinskis for favoring his brothers over him. Consequently, Zorian has no time for pointless distractions, much less other people's problems. As it happens, though, time is something he is about to get plenty of. On the eve of Cyoria's annual summer festival, Zorian is murdered, then abruptly brought back to the beginning of the month, just before he was about to take the train to school. Finding himself trapped in a time loop with no clear end or exit, he will have to look both within and without to unravel the mystery set before him. He does have to unravel it, too, because the loop clearly wasn’t made for his sake, and in a world of magic even a time traveler isn't safe from those who wish him ill. Fortunately for Zorian, repetition is the mother of learning….",

    "description": "From the number one New York Times best-selling author of the Generations Trilogy comes the second book in the Sun Symbol series (formerly Earthcore), an epic story of lost civilizations, redemption, and immeasurable treasure. With shades of Tom Clancy, Stephen King, and James Rollins, Mount Fitz Roy continues the tale of Patrick O’Doyle and Bertha Lybrand, who were part of the horror show that occurred far below the mountains of Utah. They learn that the \"mother of all motherlodes” discovered there was not unique, that there is another deposit similar to it three miles beneath the towering peak of Cerro Chaltén on the disputed border between Chile and Argentina. O'Doyle, a middle-aged former member of a disgraced black-ops unit, gets his aging team back together to go after this fortune. Funded by the mining company EarthCore, he, Bertha, and his crew of 40-something operators try to turn back the clock long enough to make them all richer than their wildest dreams. But three miles below the surface, where geothermal temperatures will cook you alive, something is waiting. Waiting, and guarding. This time, O’Doyle is well-prepared and well-armed - if he survives, he will be set for life, and he will have his revenge for the Utah massacre. Performed by Terence Aselford, Danny Gavigan, Nora Achrati, Andrew Colford, Ken Jackson, Alejandro Ruiz, Nazia Chaudhry, Wyn Delano, Rob McFadyen, Chris Davenport, Kay Eluvian, Laura C.

Welcome to the new world, in which murder is all but a thing of the past. Because when someone kills you, 999 times out of 1,000, you instantly come back to life. In this world, there are dispatchers - licensed killers who step in when you’re at risk of a natural or unintentional death. They kill you - so you can live. Tony Valdez is used to working his job as a dispatcher within the rules of the law and the state. But times are tough, and more and more Tony finds himself riding the line between what’s legal and what will pay his bills. After one of these shady gigs and after being a witness to a crime gone horribly wrong, Tony discovers that people around him are dying, for reasons that make no sense...and which just may implicate him. Tony is running out of time: to solve the mystery of these deaths, to keep others from dying, and to keep himself from being a victim of what looks like murder, by other means.",

    "description": "The Méridiens are fleeing to their far colonies - and they have reason to run. Over the course of decades, they have lost hundreds of ships, billions of people, and seven Confederation colonies to an alien enemy: an advancing swarm of silver ships transported in the bowels of a gigantic, spherical vessel.  Alex Racine, who once enjoyed the solitary life of an explorer-tug captain, is now an admiral and responsible for the lives of a quarter million Librans. Further complicating his life, Alex's Librans have made it clear they don't want to settle on his home world. They want a new home, and he must secure them one.  The silver ships await Alex's makeshift flotilla at Libre, the last colony they consumed. Thus far Alex's people have succeeded in skirmishes against the enemy's fighters. Now, though, they're preparing to attack the entire alien fleet and halt the devastation of the colonies.  To the surprise and chagrin of his officers and crew alike, Alex concocts a new plan, for he believes humanity faces not one but two alien species, and one may be enslaved to the other. If so, Alex believes, slaves should be liberated, not obliterated.  To test Alex's theory, his people must capture a wholly intact silver ship - a feat never before accomplished. The crew remains doubtful, but their admiral is determined to communicate with the aliens before he's forced to destroy them, and his wish is their command. ",

    "description": "Is your life real or is the world you live in a simulation? Are the people you call friends and neighbors living beings with inalienable rights, or are they NPCs - Non-Player Characters - whose soulless path through life is predetermined?  Samael Crane, a brilliant scientist, believes NPCs are all around us. And he can prove it.  When a body is discovered in the bay off Essex, Massachusetts, small town pastor and former Marine plagued by doubts, Ezekiel Ford finds himself called in to identify the deceased. His history is unknown. His full name is a mystery. No one knows where he came from. In fact, Ezekiel seems to be the only person in town who ever really noticed him, living on the fringe of reality, and sometimes in the homeless shelter supported by his church.  Ezekiel’s involvement in the case doesn’t go unnoticed by Samael, who has set out to prove - through deadly means - that NPCs exist, that reality is simulated, and that ‘God’ is a coder with a grudge. The two men’s missions become inextricably entwined, leading them down a path through the gray area between good and evil, science and religion, and reality and simulation, barreling toward a truth that will change the world and humankind’s place in it forever.  New York Times and number one Audible.com best-selling author Jeremy Robinson takes listeners on a journey that is not only action-packed, but full of scientific and philosophical intrigue. In his most mind-bending story since Infinite and Alter, Robinson blends genres, belief systems, and bold prose into an unputdownable tale exploring the nature of reality.  In the audiobook edition he is joined by number one Audible.com best-selling narrators, R.C. Bray and Jeffrey Kafer, creating a truly one-of-a-kind listening experience. ",

They keep the world running, the food cooked, and the horses shoed, yet what adventurer has ever spared a thought or concern for the Non-Player Characters?In the town of Maplebark, four such NPCs settle in for a night of actively ignoring the adventurers drinking in the tavern when things go quickly and fatally awry. Once the dust settles, these four find themselves faced with an impossible choice: pretend to be adventurers undertaking a task of near-certain death or see their town and loved ones destroyed. Armed only with salvaged equipment, second-hand knowledge, and a secret that could get them killed, it will take all manner of miracles if they hope to pull off their charade. And even if they succeed, the deadliest part of their journey may well be what awaits them at its end.",

Thirteen years prior, the colossal kaiju, Nemesis, ravaged the city in her relentless pursuit of retribution. Today, mankind's survival teeters on the sacrificial offerings atop a chilling monolith known as The Altar, where the condemned pay the ultimate price to prevent Nemesis's wrath from consuming humanity.</p> <p>Agent Graham, a grizzled operative on the brink of retirement, finds himself tethered to the fiery, untested Agent Tilly. Together, they are the unlikeliest of partners within the Nemesis Special Operations group, the government's first line of defense against the looming shadow of the massive Goddess of Vengeance. Their mission? To hunt down the enigmatic cult, Divine Retribution, before they can harness the devastating power of Nemesis to reshape the world to their warped sense of righteousness.</p> <p>As Graham and Tilly plunge into Boston's darkest underbelly, they face more than just the echoes of their city's past. They must outwit cunning cultists, battle impossible monsters on the windswept beaches of Martha's Vineyard, and forge an unexpected alliance with the motley and formidable all-female biker gang inspired by the Queen of Monsters, the 'Nemesisters.' Every step drives them closer to the unthinkable and asks the questions:</p> <p>How many must be sacrificed to save the world from the ever-watchful gaze of Nemesis? How many more will she demand when the world needs to be saved?</p>",

Murderbot returns in its highly anticipated, first full-length stand-alone novel, Network Effect. You know that feeling when you’re at work and you’ve had enough of people, and then the boss walks in with yet another job that needs to be done right this second or the world will end, but all you want to do is go home and binge your favorite shows? And you're a sentient murder machine programmed for destruction? Congratulations, you're Murderbot. Come for the pew-pew space battles, stay for the most relatable AI you’ll listen to this century. I’m usually alone in my head, and that’s where 90-plus percent of my problems are. When Murderbot's human associates (not friends, never friends) are captured and another not-friend from its past requires urgent assistance, Murderbot must choose between inertia and drastic action. Drastic action it is, then.",

They always come round again. That's why they're called revolutions. People die, and nothing changes.'</i><br /> <br /> For a policeman, there can be few things worse than a serial killer loose in your city. Except, perhaps, a serial killer who targets coppers, and a city on the brink of bloody revolution.<br /> <br /> For<b> Commander Sam Vimes,</b> it all feels horribly familiar.

It's worse than a vegetarian touting organically grown steaks.\" (Eric, physics teacher, involuntary vampire, and part-time demon slayer) </p> <p>Eric didn't ask to be a vampire. In fact he didn't even believe in them. Biting your own tongue with your fangs does a lot of convincing. Even so, being a part-time undead isn't as easy as you might think. It can let you hold down a day job, true, but sometimes the night \"life\" can be more than a little difficult, what with those bloodthirsty urges and predatory instincts kicking in. Luckily for Eric he can rely on his trusty steed and her unwavering support, his flaming sword and its sarcastic wit, and his own snarky sense of humor. </p>",

Kel Command gives her the opportunity to redeem herself by retaking the Fortress of Scattered Needles, a star fortress that has recently been captured by heretics. Cheris' career isn't the only thing at stake. If the fortress falls, the Hexarchate itself might be next. Cheris' best hope is to ally with the undead tactician Shuos Jedao. The good news is that Jedao has never lost a battle, and he may be the only one who can figure out how to successfully besiege the fortress. The bad news is that Jedao went mad in his first life and massacred two armies, one of them his own. As the siege wears on, Cheris must decide how far she can trust Jedao - because she might be his next victim. </p>",

At the end of that battle, he claimed Helga Helsdottir, soul-bonding her and renaming her Helga Oathsworn. With a Valkyrie by his side, Sean hoped never to lose another loved one to death. His enemies were far from done with him, however.</p><p>Attacks on the association and their families started, claiming lives and hurting Sean’s friends. Finished with just trying to live his life, Sean made plans to take on his enemies directly. The turning point came when Sean confronted Denmur and his group outside the Golden Lion. Helga struck down Denmur’s champion, Knight Mithrilarm, during the ensuing duel, causing Denmur to snap. The fight left Denmur, plus dozens of others, dead. Even that wasn’t the end - the corrupt guards in Lord Sharpeyes’ pay arrested Sean and Helga.</p><p>As they were brought before Magister Amuret, Sean discovered just how far he’d pushed his enemies when he was attacked and killed in the courtroom. Death could not stop Sean while he had energy to invoke his gifts from the Tuatha. Pushing death away, Sean got back to his feet and killed the guards and magistrate who had tried to murder him. He was brought before the unusually reasonable chief magistrate, who found Sean innocent of any wrongdoing.&nbsp;</p><p>Sean’s bond with Helga gave him access to new planes, including the Bog. That was where the souls of Sean’s foes now went if they died while in combat with him. In an effort to find out more about who was directing the attacks against him, Sean paid a visit to the dead in the Bog. He was determined to end the troubles facing him, even if it meant finding a noble solution.</p>",

    "description": "The Omnian expeditionary fleet sails for the faraway place they call \"the wall\". The worlds of humankind have consolidated their resources to create a powerful armada to confront the alien federation. During the Omnians' previous encounter with an alien fleet at the wall, the Nua'll comm sphere spoke to them in multiple languages. When the messages were deciphered by SADEs, the humans' digital friends, the Omnians realized two things. One, they would face a vast empire composed of hundreds of races, and, two, the Nua'll were not the leaders of the federacy. They had spoken of masters. Multiple challenges faced Alex Racine, the Omnian leader, to cobble together the fleet he required. The Confederation, which was composed of many colonies, could produce ships, but most of its people lacked the will to fight. Haraken and New Terra were worlds with limited material production capability. But they produced individuals who were anxious to deliver a blow against the federation. A debate raged over whether humans should flee, wait, or fight the onslaught of giant spheres, which ravaged humankind's worlds, and the probes that spied on them. It was Alex Racine's choice to confront the alien race. Anything less was only delaying the inevitable. The Omnians knew nothing about what they would find beyond the wall, where the federation's enormous empire lay. Alex knew he couldn't defeat the federacy in a long series of protracted engagements. His plan was to attempt to conquer and divide. He just needed to find the right sentient race for his idea to work.",

The first complication is an unmistakable sign of sinister agendas afoot: a squirrel atop the train. But an even more ominous situation is in store when the trio plus Atticus stumble across a murder upon arrival at the station. They recognize Detective Gabriela Ibarra, who's there to investigate. But they also recognize the body - or rather that the body is a doppelganger for Atticus himself. </p> <p>The police, hampered by human senses of smell and a decided lack of canine intuition, obviously can't handle this alone. Not with Atticus likely in danger. Oberon knows it's time to investigate once more - for justice! For gravy! And possibly greasy tacos! </p> <p>Alongside his faithful Druid, Oberon and the other loyal hounds navigate by nose through Portland to find a bear-shifter friend with intel, delicious clues at the victim's home, and more squirrels. Always more squirrels! </p> <p>But will our hungry band of heroes be able to identify the culprit before someone else is murdered? Will there be mystery meat in gravy as a reward or tragedy in store for the world's (or at least the Pacific Northwest's) greatest dog detective? </p> <p>Like its predecessor <i>The Purloined Poodle</i>, the latest of Oberon's Meaty Mysteries novella, <i>The Squirrel on the Train</i>, is not to be missed by fans of Kevin Hearne's <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Iron Druid series. </p>",

Dean Parker has brought his wife home, and he’s looking forward to relaxing and having a future with his family on New Spero. The Iskios vortex is gone, vanquished by the Hero of Earth, but unforeseen enemies linger in the universe.   The Bhlat send a warning to the humans, one that suggests the Kraski may not all be dead. All signs point to Lom of Pleva, a wealthy and very dangerous enemy to have.    Dean must unite with the Bhlat to fight against a common adversary, but when push comes to shove, can he trust them?   Join Dean and the others as they seek to save themselves from the race of beings that beamed them off Earth years ago, setting everything in motion.

First he visited his wife's grave. Then he joined the army.<br /> <br /> The good news is that humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce—and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding.<br /> <br /> Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity's resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don't want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You'll be taken off Earth and never allowed to return. You'll serve two years at the front. And if you survive, you'll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets.<br /> <br /> John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect. Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far, far harder than he can imagine—and what he will become is far stranger. <br /> <br /> John Scalzi's <i>Old Man's War </i>is a stunning novel of the long war for human survival—in a universe replete with hostility</p>",

Few of the Harakens with Alex thought there was little he could do to bring peace to the embroiled planet. From their viewpoint, the demands of the Celus-5 Swei Swee, the six-legged aliens of the ocean, and the Dischnya, the warring, doglike, intelligent creatures who inhabited the dry plains, were too convoluted to solve.  Except Alex doesn't see fulfilling the desires of the two sentient species, identifying the third species hiding in the green, and gaining permission for humans and SADEs to settle the planet as challenges. To Alex, these are merely stepping-stones to what he seeks.  Two centuries ago Swei Swee escaped from their masters, the Nua'll, and landed their dark travelers on the shoreline of Celus-5. This was the first clue the Harakens had received in 20 years as to the direction the enormous and deadly alien sphere of the Nua'll originated before it attacked the first Confederation colony.  Alex was intent on solving the thorny issues of Celus-5 so he could garner the Dischnya's support to help him solve the burning questions: When and from which direction did the Nua'll sphere enter the Celus system? To do this and prevent potential future attacks on human worlds, Alex realizes he must shed the responsibilities of the past years and return to the foundations on which he built Haraken, which were city-ships, Independents, and SADEs.

    "description": "<p>Corin Cadence finally has a firm reason to believe his brother, Tristan, is still alive. Unfortunately, finding more information isn’t going to be easy. Tristan appears to be entangled with a clandestine organization that calls themselves Whispers. And Corin’s last brush with the Whispers didn’t exactly end well.</p> <p>As much as he wants to follow that lead, Corin has more pressing problems to deal with. Sera is still suffering from a mysterious malady that has stolen her voice and her magic. Corin knows that a portion of that is his fault, and he’s determined to fix it. His mother is still off in another country, and there are growing odds that she’s involved with a conspiracy to overthrow the visages.</p> <p>Corin has also been branded with a new magical mark on his right hand - one that even veteran climbers don’t seem to recognize. He’s going to need to figure out how it works, otherwise it could be more of a vulnerability than an asset.</p> <p>Corin still hasn’t finished his first year at Lorian Heights. If he fails his final exams, he’ll be sent off to the military and lose his chance to investigate his brother’s fate. And finally, there’s the issue of enemies. He might have made a few of them.</p> <p>The biggest problem? He’s not sure if Jin, once one of his closest companions, is one of them.</p>",

    "description": "<p><b>From the author of the Gods Are Bastards series comes a new isekai adventure, in which a man is granted sinister powers he doesn't even want.</b></p> <p>On a typical day, on an average train platform, two warring sister goddesses found their avatars. One avatar, the young Yoshi, was swept away to the world of Ephemera to be a great hero of honor, courage, and light. The other, the not-so-young Seiji, was swept away to become a dark lord out to kill or conquer all in his path.</p> <p>But Seiji is in absolutely no mood for that nonsense. It's bad enough that on Earth he was a closed-off, misanthropic grouch with zero patience for other people. Now he's supposed to muster enough of a give-a-damn to lead vile hordes, crush Yoshi, and take all of Ephemera as his own? No thanks. Unfortunately, he doesn't have a choice.</p> <p>Seiji's patron goddess wants results, and if he doesn't deliver, she's going to take a serious interest in discovering his pain, suffering, and overall misery threshold. But just because he doesn't care about people, doesn't mean he doesn't care whether they suffer by his own hand. After all, just because you're the embodiment of ultimate evil doesn't mean you have to be a jerk about it.</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit fantasy adventure series—with more than five million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>",

Follow Cal Stringel's misadventures as he climbs to the lowest levels of supervillany in the prequel to the smash hit, Confessions of a D-List Supervillain. Angry that he wouldn't be known as the engineer who made Ultraweapon's force blasters, Cal resigns to chase after a bigger, better paycheck.  However, the Promethia Corporation isn't going to let him go that easily and sets out to make his life a living hell. Fed up at being pushed around by a company with an endless supply of lawyers and litigation, Cal sets out to build his own version of Ultraweapon's powered armor and take his revenge!  What Cal doesn't count on is just how hard this is going to be.  Along the way, he will make both friends and enemies and discover how hard hitting rock bottom can feel. Whether Cal is trying to smooth talk his way out of the prison for supervillains, haggle with nefarious employers over the price of his inventions, or battle with the Gulf Coast Guardians, he's in for one wild ride!  He'll need to learn that when money is tight that everything has a price - from the cost of making weapons for a psychotic speedster to how much to charge for taking the blame for a drunken rampage through Las Vegas.

    "description": "When the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts, it's up to six college students and their experimental physics project to prevent the end of civilization.  When an experiment to study quantum uncertainty goes spectacularly wrong, physics student Bill Rustad and his friends find that they have accidentally created an inter-dimensional portal. They connect to Outland - an alternate Earth with identical geology, but where humans never evolved. The group races to establish control of the portal before the government, the military, or evildoers can take it away.   Then everything changes when the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts in an explosion large enough to destroy civilization and kill half the planet. The team has just hours to get as many people as possible across to Outland before a lethal cloud of ash overwhelms them.  Nothing has prepared the refugees for what they find - a world of few resources and unprecedented dangers. Somehow, they must learn to survive, because Outland may not just be a safe haven - it could be their new home.",

Now, it's not only the weight of her world on her shoulders—Quinn must connect with the library system before the universe itself disintegrates.</p> <p>Once she's settled, it should be quiet, peaceful work—just as soon as she battles a few engorged bookworms, repairs hundreds of years of damage, and figures out why there's been no librarian for the last several centuries.</p> <p>And once that's done she can start gathering overdue books. All 18,042 of them to start.</p> <p>There'll be a helluva lot of late fees to process.</p>",

Riddle, the worldwide best-selling author of <i>The Atlantis Gene</i> and <i>Departure</i>, comes a novel that will change everything you think you know about pandemics. </p> <p>A hundred miles north of Alaska, an American Coast Guard vessel discovers a sunken submarine at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean. It has no national identification and doesn't match the records of any known vessel. Deep within, researchers find evidence of a scientific experiment that will alter our very understanding of the human race. </p> <p>In Atlanta, Dr. Peyton Shaw is awakened by the phone call she has dreaded for years. As the CDC's leading epidemiologist, she's among the first responders to outbreaks around the world. It's a lonely and dangerous job, but it's her life - and she's good at it. This time she may have met her match. In Kenya, an Ebola-like pathogen has infected two Americans. One lies at death's door. With the clock ticking, Peyton assembles her team and joins personnel from the Kenyan Ministry of Health and the WHO. What they find in the remote village is beyond their worst fears. As she traces the origin of the pathogen, Peyton begins to believe that there is more to this outbreak - that it may be merely the opening act in a conspiracy with far-reaching consequences. </p> <p>In Berlin, Desmond Hughes awakens in a hotel room with no memory of how he got there or who he is. On the floor he finds a dead security guard from an international pharmaceutical company. His only clue leads him to Peyton Shaw - a woman who seems to know him but refuses to tell him how. With the police searching the city for him, Desmond desperately tries to piece together what happened to him. To his shock and horror, he learns that he may be involved in causing the outbreak - and could hold the only key to stopping it. </p> <p>As the pathogen spreads around the world, Peyton and Desmond race to unravel the conspiracy behind the pandemic - and uncover secrets some want to keep buried. </p>",

Not that he'd ever admit it, but maybe he's been waiting - waiting for the traveler to come back. The one who's roared into his life twice before, pausing just long enough to drop tantalizing clues before disappearing in a cloud of gunfire and a squeal of tires. The one who's a walking anachronism, with her tricorne hat, flintlock rifle, and steampunked Model A Ford.  The one who's being pursued by...something.  So when the mysterious traveler finally reappears, Eli's determined that this time, he's going to get some answers. But his hunt soon yields far more than he bargained for, plunging him headlong into a dizzying world full of competing factions and figures straight out of legend.  To make sense of the mystery at its heart, he must embark on a breakneck chase across the country and through two centuries of history - with nothing less than America's past, present, and future at stake.

But their rivalries divided them in endless battles for supremacy - until one dark lord at last united the Sith in the quest to enslave the galaxy and exterminate the Jedi. Yet it would fall to another, far more powerful than the entire Brotherhood of Darkness, to ultimately realize the full potential of the Sith and wield the awesome power of the dark side as never before. </p> <p>Since childhood, Dessel has known only the abuse of his hateful father and the dangerous, soul-crushing labor of a cortosis miner. Deep in the tunnels of the desolate planet Apatros, endlessly excavating the rare mineral valued throughout the galaxy, Dessel dreams of the day he can escape - a day he fears may never come. But when a high-stakes card game ends in deadly violence, Dessel suddenly finds himself a wanted man. </p> <p>On the run from vengeful Republic forces, Dessel vanishes into the ranks of the Sith army and ships out to join the bloody war against the Republic and its Jedi champions. There, Dessel’s brutality, cunning, and exceptional command of the Force swiftly win him renown as a warrior. But in the eyes of his watchful masters, he is destined for a far greater role in the ultimate Sith plan for the galaxy - if he can prove himself truly worthy. </p> <p>As an acolyte in the Sith academy, studying the secrets and skills of the dark side at the feet of its greatest masters, Dessel embraces his new Sith identity: Bane. However the true test is yet to come. In order to gain acceptance into the Brotherhood of Darkness, one must fully surrender to the dark side through a trial by fire that Bane, for all his unquenchable fury and lust for power, may not be strong enough to endure... especially since deception, treachery, and murder run rampant among the Sith disciples, and utter ruthlessness alone is the key to survival. </p> <p>Only by defying the most sacred traditions, rejecting all he has been taught, and drawing upon the long-forgotten wisdom of the very first Sith can Bane hope to triumph - and forge from the ashes of that which he must destroy a new era of absolute dark power.</p>",

It's a proving ground steeped with science and engineering designed to push warships faster than ever before, and armed to confront the growing menace of a universe where everything is influenced by a hidden evil.</p> <p>As Van and his crew grow into their new roles, Perry unlocks a memory that reaches into the very beginning of the Tudor family's service nearly a century earlier.</p> <p>But sometimes, the truth is hidden for a reason, and Van must decide—How much does he really want to know? And how far can he take his ship, knowing there's a price on his head?</p>",

At its core is a dead zone, devoid of life, where government agencies crash their obsolete satellites and space stations, confident they won't harm a soul. When the International Space Station suffers a catastrophic failure and plummets through the atmosphere, it's here that Mission Specialist Julie Rohr, an astrobiologist studying living space dust called xylem, finds herself marooned. Julie's only hope for rescue lies in the hands of her estranged father, Dr. Finn Maddern, a renowned mycologist.",

While hiding Lilly, a chimera cat-girl rescued from Island 731, from GOD - the Genetic Offense Directive, a black ops organization within DARPA - Hudson attempts to raise Maigo, the teenage girl who once was part of Nemesis - the now deceased goddess of vengeance. But the two strange girls can't be protected from what comes next.  Nemesis Lives  Kept in a massive warehouse operated by GOD, Nemesis's body is violated by the Tsuchi, the spider-like chimera also developed on Island 731. It spawns three Kaiju-sized variations of the deadly creatures and wakes Nemesis from her regenerative slumber. Nemesis, fueled by an unquenchable thirst for vengeance, and now lacking Maigo's conscience, storms after the Tsuchi, which have fled south, toward Los Angeles, and inland...toward GOD's headquarters at Area 51.  Sacrifices Must Be Made  To stop the infinitely hungry Tsuchi, and the rampaging Nemesis, Hudson and crew must make alliances with enemies - combining personal experience, future technology and bold actions. But for the world to once again be safe from a Kaiju menace, one of their own must give themselves up to the goddess of vengeance. ",

He is now a husband and a father, surrounded by a team who have become a family. So when a series of strange new threats rise from the depths and fall from the sky, the stakes are higher than ever.  THE HARBINGERS ARRIVE  While Maigo, the young woman who was once a part of the kaiju known as Nemesis, goddess of vengeance, and Lilly, a chimera cat-woman, sneak off to investigate Big Diomede, an island with an ancient secret inside Russian territory, two monsters fall from the sky. One heads for Tokyo, the other for the already battered Boston. Tsunamis rise from the depths, leveling cities. The two new kaiju - Giger and Lovecraft - follow close behind, bringing death and destruction with them. And Hudson realizes the horrible truth: the Aeros, an alien race plotting mankind's destruction, have sent these kaiju in advance.  THE WAR BEGINS  Drawn by the chaos, and by her connection to people she and her new \"voice\", Katsu Endo, are fond of, Nemesis rises to the defense of humanity. But the Queen of the Monsters is not alone. Maigo and Lilly unleash an ancient protector known as Hyperion, and the first battle for the fate of the human race, in all dimensions, begins. ",

    "description": "The Signal Was Received  Ten years after a deep-space transmission was broadcast from a futuristic citadel hidden in the Arctic ice, Jon Hudson finds himself in a position beyond comprehension. His days of lazy Sasquatch hunting on behalf of the DHS' Fusion Center-Paranormal (FC-P) have been a fading memory since the appearance of Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance, reborn through genetic tinkering. Now he longs for those quiet days once more.  The Aeros Have Returned  Facing down giant kaiju has become almost commonplace for Hudson and the FC-P, whom he regards as his family, but the threat now facing them is global. An alien race known as the Aeros, summoned to Earth 10 years ago, have arrived in orbit, hell-bent on destroying their ancient enemy, the Ferox, along with all of humanity...in all dimensions of reality.  All Earths Will Be Destroyed  Facing off against an invasion of city-destroying kaiju, a massive mothership and an assault in a parallel world, Hudson must bolster the FC-P's ranks. Joined by Milos \"Cowboy\" Vesely, Hudson must journey through alternate dimensions to gather a one-of-a-kind legion of defenders, including a smart-mouthed soldier, a woman who can animate the lifeless, a time traveler, a robot-man, a powerful king, and an assassin who can slip between frequencies of reality.  With Project Legion, Jeremy Robinson has created an epic series finale, bringing together characters and plot elements from more than a dozen different novels and series. The result is a crossover novel ten years in the making, the likes of which have never been seen outside of comic books and movies like Captain America: Civil War.  Project Legion is an apocalyptic end to the first story arc of the bestselling Kaiju Thriller series: The Nemesis Saga. ",

In the time since Boston fell and Nemesis retreated to the ocean's depths, Hudson has helped prepare the United States against future attacks. But no one is prepared for what rises from the depths. </p> <p>Five Kaiju attack cities and consume the world's citizens in an unstoppable rampage around the globe. But it soon becomes apparent that these attacks aren't all random events. Hudson is targeted, putting the FC-P headquarters, known as the Crow's Nest, and his team, in the very large crosshairs. General Lance Gordon, a man who carries Nemesis' vengeful heart in his chest, directs the Kaiju, and when Hudson finds protection from an unlikely source, the General turns his attention to his next target. </p> <p>While Gordon and his Kaiju storm toward Washington, D.C., Hudson, along with his team and some new and unusual allies, race to stand in their path, hoping to spare the nation - and the world - from destruction. But salvation at the end of all things will come only through the gravest of sacrifices. </p> <p>With <i>Project Nemesis</i>, Jeremy Robinson introduced the world of popular fiction to Kaiju, a word that has become popularized by the movie Pacific Rim, and is associated with classic movie monsters such as Godzilla and Gamera. In the year since the release of <i>Project Nemesis</i>, the audiobook has become the best-selling original Kaiju novel of all time, and it is being featured in the video game <i>Colossal Kaiju Combat: Fall of Nemesis</i>. In <i>Project Maigo</i>, Robinson amps up the scale, the characters and the city-stomping action, treating listeners to a truly monstrous experience typically reserved for the big screen.</p>",

    "description": "Jon Hudson, lead investigator for the Department of Homeland Security's Fusion Center-P, thinks his job is a joke. While other Fusion Centers focus on thwarting terrorist activity, Hudson's division is tasked with handling paranormal threats to national security, of which there have been zero during his years at the DHS. When yet another Sasquatch sighting leads to a research facility in the backwoods of Maine, disguised as an abandoned Nike missile site, Hudson's job becomes deadly serious.  Hudson and the local Sherriff, Ashley Collins, suddenly find themselves on the run from a ruthless ex-Special Forces security team, but the human threat is short-lived as something very much not-human destroys the facility and heads for civilization, leaving only a single clue behind-a name scrawled in blood-Nemesis. Working with his team at Fusion Center-P, Sherriff Collins and a surly helicopter pilot named Woodstock, Hudson pursues the creature known as Nemesis, attempts to uncover the corporate secrets behind its creation and accidental release, and tries to comprehend why several clues lead to a murdered little girl named Maigo.  But as the body-count explodes, along with the monster's size, it quickly becomes clear that nothing short of a full military response can slow Nemesis's progress. Coordinating with every branch of the U.S. military, Hudson simultaneously searches for clues about Nemesis's origins and motivations, and leads the counterattack that will hopefully stop the monster before it reaches Boston and its one million residents.  Witness the birth of a legend as Jeremy Robinson, bestselling author of SecondWorld and Ragnarok, combines the pacing of Matthew Reilly with the mystery of James Rollins and creates the first iconic American Kaiju* story since King Kong.  *Kaiju is Japanese for \"strange beast.\" The genre includes classic monsters such as Godzilla, Gamera, Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah.",

BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.<br /> <br /> <b>'\"LOOK AFTER THE DEAD,\" SAID THE PRIESTS, \"AND THE DEAD WOULD LOOK AFTER YOU.\"'</b><br /> <br /> Young Prince Teppic is sent far away from his desert homeland to the city of Ankh-Morpork for the best education money can buy. Which just so happens to be at the Assassins' Guild.<br /> <br /> But when Teppic's father dies suddenly, fate takes him away from assassination to something far more unsavoury: politics. Teppic returns home to the small, penniless kingdom of Djelibeybi to take his place as ruler.<br /> <br /> It isn't easy, being a teenage pharaoh. As tradition dictates, the new king must build a monumental pyramid to honour his dead father. But this one might just bankrupt the kingdom, and warp the very fabric of time and space itself...<br /> <br /> The Discworld novels can be listened to in any order but<i> Pyramids</i> is a standalone.<br /> <br /> The first book in the Discworld series - <i>The Colour of Magic</i> - was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.<br /> <br /> <b>'Pratchett remains a consistently clever, charming and funny voice' - </b><b><i>Independent</i></b></p>",

Commander Jess Cinders and Admiral Lucia Bellardo fight the troubles besieging the outpost from multiple directions. Sand serpents, Usaanans, are suspected of undercutting outpost contracts, necessitating Major Sam Fleetfoot investigate the source of their production. His time on the Lemgart’s home world, with Lieutenant Candace Weller, progresses through a series of alien contacts. When the Usaanans are exposed, the sand serpents attempt to eliminate the human pair. Meanwhile, Chief Engineer Mickey Brandon and his teams, led by the SADEs, investigate the Messinants domes. Their aim is to duplicate the ancient race’s technique of transporting individuals and goods through quantum-linked platforms, called Q-gates. The teams produce requests for console inputs that stymie them and lead to cataclysmic events. Omnian co-leader Alex Racine’s mysterious dreams turn into nightmares, and he fears for events in alliance space. The dreams herald multiple calamities, such as the loss of the Transit Tripper. The freighter, carrying an alien drone from the Worlds of Light, was sent to Mickey to examine. To make matters worse, the Colony has escalated its tactics against the Resistance. The alliance defenders, having had a modicum of success, recently suffered setbacks. Jess must add to Mickey’s tasks, requesting the chief engineer find a way to defeat the Colony’s new energy weapons before more lives and ships are lost.",

At CERN, he analyses data generated by the Large Hadron Collider, the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator. Now, Ty believes he's found a pattern in its output. It looks like an organised data stream, being broadcast over what he calls a quantum radio.</p> <p>Could it be a signal from another universe? A message sent from the future? Or something else entirely?</p> <p>As Ty peels back the layers of his discovery, he learns that what he's found isn't what he thought it was. The encoded message is far more profound. It may alter our understanding of human existence and the universe.</p> <p>But Ty is not the only one looking for it. Someone has been following his research for a long time. And they'll do anything to prevent him from unravelling what is being broadcast by the quantum radio...</p> <p>Because the first one to discover the truth may well control the future.</p>",

Erin Solstice is going further abroad than she's ever dreamed: as far as the Walled City of Pallass, the City of Invention. With the magic door drawing the attention of world powers and the looming crisis of the Goblin Lord, Erin Solstice's inn is busier than ever.",

While some of the attention is good and allows for personal growth, most of it is from various organizations that feel threatened by the sudden upswing of power that Joe's guild - The Wanderers - is attaining. As the threat to Earth begins to reach its peak, all of humanity has a choice: flee to Eternium, or stay for an uncertain future. Some stay, some go, some don't make the choice quickly enough. In Ardania, the human Kingdom is seeing an unprecedented influx of people. Supply and demand is an issue no matter where you go, as a civilization of a few million can't prepare to accept an eighth of Earth's inhabitants at once. Joe sets out to solve problems where he can, but he can't be there for everyone...especially when a group of smiling enforcers are working to bring him down.",

    "description": "From number one best-selling author Brandon Sanderson and Janci Patterson comes the second of three Skyward series novellas, each told from the perspective of a different member of the team back on Detritus. Listen to Alanik's story between Starsight and Cytonic. “Don’t trust their lies. Don’t trust their false peace.” That is the warning that Alanik of the planet ReDawn gave the human pilot Spensa after Alanik’s ship crash-landed on Detritus. While accepting an invitation to meet with her people’s enemy, the Galactic Superiority, Alanik heard Spensa’s cry for help across the vastness of space, and she used her cytonic powers to hyperjump her ship to the source of that cry. What she found there was a shock - a whole planet of free humans fighting against the Superiority. Were they the allies her people desperately needed?  When she recovered from her injuries and met the friendly humans Jorgen and FM of Skyward Flight, she found that her warning to Spensa had gone unheeded by the government of Detritus, and they were considering a peace overture from the Superiority. Now having returned to ReDawn, Alanik is dismayed to learn that her own people are falling into the exact same trap.  The faction in ReDawn’s government that wants to appease the Superiority has gained the upper hand. With Alanik’s mentor, Renakin captured, she has no one to turn to but Jorgen, FM, and their friend Rig. An ancient technology may have the power to save both of their planets from disaster, but can they discover its secrets before it’s too late?

    "description": "At once wildly original and stuffed with irresistible nostalgia, Ready Player One is a spectacularly genre-busting, ambitious, and charming debut - part quest novel, part love story, and part virtual space opera set in a universe where spell-slinging mages battle giant Japanese robots, entire planets are inspired by Blade Runner, and flying DeLoreans achieve light speed. It’s the year 2044, and the real world is an ugly place. Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes his grim surroundings by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia that lets you be anything you want to be, a place where you can live and play and fall in love on any of 10,000 planets.  And like most of humanity, Wade dreams of being the one to discover the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this virtual world. For somewhere inside this giant networked playground, OASIS creator James Halliday has hidden a series of fiendish puzzles that will yield massive fortune - and remarkable power - to whoever can unlock them.  For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that Halliday’s riddles are based in the pop culture he loved - that of the late 20th century. And for years, millions have found in this quest another means of escape, retreating into happy, obsessive study of Halliday’s icons. Like many of his contemporaries, Wade is as comfortable debating the finer points of John Hughes’s oeuvre, playing Pac-Man, or reciting Devo lyrics as he is scrounging power to run his OASIS rig.  And then Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle.  Suddenly the whole world is watching, and thousands of competitors join the hunt - among them certain powerful players who are willing to commit very real murder to beat Wade to this prize. Now the only way for Wade to survive and preserve everything he knows is to win. But to do so, he may have to leave behind his oh-so-perfect virtual existence and face up to life - and love - in the real world he’s always been so desperate to escape.  A world at stake.A quest for the ultimate prize.Are you ready?",

    "description": "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin.</b><br /> <br /> <b>Over 1 million Discworld audiobooks sold – discover the extraordinary universe of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld like never before</b><br /> <br /> The audiobook of <i>Reaper Man </i>is narrated by the BAFTA award-winning actor Sian Clifford (<i>Fleabag</i>; <i>Vanity Fair</i>; <i>Quiz</i>). BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.<br /> <br /> <b>'Inside every living person is a dead person waiting to get out.'</b><br /> <br /> Death has been fired by the Auditors of Reality for the heinous crime of developing...a <i>personality</i>. Sent to live like everyone else, Death takes a new name and begins working as a farmhand. He's got the scythe already, after all.<br /> <br /> And for humanity, Death is just...gone. Which leads to the kind of chaos you always get when an important public service is withdrawn. If Death doesn't come for you, then what are you supposed to do in the meantime?<br /> <br /> You can't have the undead wandering about like lost souls-there's no telling what might happen. Particularly when they discover that life really is only for the living...<br /> <br /> The Discworld novels can be listened to in any order, but <i>Reaper Man</i> is the second book in the Death series.<br /> <br /> The first book in the Discworld series-<i>The Colour of Magic</i>-was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.<br /> <br /> </p>",

But especially when to run.</b><br /> <br /> Lily Red, known as \"Little Red\", has trained her entire life to become a system-acknowledged scout under her Grandmother's guidance. Hunting, tracking, and trap-making—she's a master of her craft. But her dreams of joining the elite Scout forces are repeatedly blocked by a leader of the Wyld with a grudge against Grandmother.<br /> <br /> When Lily uncovers an impending invasion by Wolf Warband, brutal raiders from the frozen north, a deadly challenge offered by their war leader sets her pulse racing. She's his partner in prophecy, so as far as he's concerned she's the only person in the way. Little Red races away to warn the Wyld, but the city's rulers mock her warnings as fairy tales, dismissing the threat entirely. Undeterred, she vows to protect the people of Canu Moch herself.<br /> <br /> But Lily isn't about to back down. She'll be the competent protector of the people of Canu Moch—whether they want her or not. With the three city-states planning to ignore the danger, she strikes out on her own, quickly finding herself on the razor's edge between duty and ambition as Little Red pits herself against the Big Bad Wolf.<br /> <br /> <b>Stay on the path.

It’s a prestige posting, and Andrew is thrilled all the more to be assigned to the ship’s Xenobiology laboratory. Life couldn’t be better…until Andrew begins to pick up on the facts that (1) every Away Mission involves some kind of lethal confrontation with alien forces; (2) the ship’s captain, its chief science officer, and the handsome Lieutenant Kerensky always survive these confrontations; and (3) at least one low-ranked crew member is, sadly, always killed.  Not surprisingly, a great deal of energy below decks is expended on avoiding, at all costs, being assigned to an Away Mission. Then Andrew stumbles on information that completely transforms his and his colleagues’ understanding of what the starship Intrepid really is…and offers them a crazy, high-risk chance to save their own lives.",

A robotic race, ally and destroyer alike.</p> <p>The Republic of Exilium has grown in strength and confidence at the far end of the galaxy from the rest of mankind, sending out scout ships to survey the worlds around them as they try to learn more about the mysterious Construction Matrix AIs.</p> <p>Finding one of the genocidal rogues of that mysterious “race” in the process of destroying an inhabited world, Captain Octavio Catalan takes his ship into a desperate battle. He is victorious - but he is too late. The world of the strange aliens he has encountered is doomed.</p> <p>The distant Republic can barely help, but the honor of their leaders will not permit them to stand idly by. Ships and crews are set into motion to commence a desperate evacuation of their newfound friends, and debts with the strange Matrices are called in.</p> <p>One branch of Matrices destroyed the planet. Another may well save it - but the AIs have their own agenda and the price they ask may be beyond the Republic and its new allies....</p>",

So long as he can keep his ship floating, he's free to live the life he wants. But that all changes when he meets Abigail Pryar, a nun looking for safe passage out of the system. Too bad there's something off about the cargo she's carrying.</p> <p>Jace knows he shouldn't ask too many questions, but when strange sounds start coming from inside the large, metal box, he can't help but check it out. Big mistake. To make matters worse, he's being pursued by unknown ships - people who want that cargo. Does Jace give up the goods and hand over the nun ...or does he risk it all for an even bigger payout?</p> <p><b><i>Renegade Atlas, book Two</i></b></p> <p>The search for Earth has begun.</p> <p>After barely escaping the Union's grasp, <i>The Renegade Star</i> is off to parts unknown. Every member of its crew is a wanted fugitive. None of them can ever return home.</p> <p>But all is not lost. Thanks to Lex, a strange girl with a remarkable gift, the path to Earth has been revealed. According to ancient myth, Earth holds valuable treasures, lost technology, and endless secrets, ripe for the taking. Jace and his new friends have a chance to discover it all, but only if they can keep Lex out of the Union's grasp.</p> <p>Doing so won't be easy. With enemies on all sides, the deck is stacked against them, but nothing in this universe comes easy when you're a Renegade.</p> <p>If you're a fan of <i>Firefly</i>, <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>, or <i>Leviathan Wakes</i>, you'll love this epic, space opera thriller.</p> <p><b>Warning: This book contains action, cussing, and general badassery.

The world as you know it wouldn't be the same without him. Denny was born into one of the lowest rungs of society, but his bleak fortunes abruptly change when the mysterious Upjohn Institute recruits him to be a Rewinder, a verifier of personal histories. The job at first sounds like it involves researching old books and records, but Denny soon learns it's far from it. A Rewinder's job is to observe history. In person. Embracing his new life with enthusiasm, Denny witnesses things he could never even imagine before. But as exciting a life as this is, there are dangers, too. For even the smallest error can have consequences. Life-altering consequences. Time, after all, is merely a reference point.",

The issue with creating your own path is that you have no idea what awaits you, especially when low charisma guarantees legendary misunderstandings. For Jaxon, that’s half the fun.  Rexus is a Completionist Chronicles side quest focused on Jaxon and is meant to be heard following Regicide.",

Becoming a permanent addition to a game world, it doesn't take long to learn that people with his abilities are actively hunted. In fact, if the wrong people gained knowledge of what he was capable of, assassins would appear in droves.  In his pursuit of power, Joe fights alongside his team, completes quests, and delves into the mysteries of his class, which he quickly discovers can be practiced only in secret. Ultimately, his goal is to complete every mission, master every ability, and learn all of the world's secrets. All he has to do is survive long enough to make that happen.",

    "description": "Three 20-somethings are all that stands between an otherworldly threat and the survival of Earth in the latest thrill ride by Dennis E. Taylor, author of the Audible and New York Times best-selling Bobiverse series. Jack Kernigan is having a bad day...a bad year...a bad life. After being booted out of MIT, he’s back in his Ohio hometown, working for the family business, facing a life of mediocrity. Then one day, out on a delivery, his truck hits...something. Something big...something furry...something invisible. And, it turns out, something not of this Earth. Fate can play funny tricks. Which is why Jack suddenly finds himself the planet’s best hope to unravel a conspiracy of galactic proportions that could spell the end of the human race. All Jack and his best friends, Natalie and Patrick, have to defeat an alien threat is their wits, a lot of coffee, and a rather snippy AI named Sheldon. Plus, their own spaceship. After all, if you’re going to rescue the world, the least you can get out of it is your own spaceship.",

    "description": "<p>In the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller <i>Darth Bane: Path of Destruction,</i> Drew Karpyshyn painted a gripping portrait of a young man’s journey from innocence to evil. That man was Darth Bane, a twisted genius whose iron will, fierce ambition, and strength in the dark side of the Force made him a natural leader among the Sith - until his radical embrace of an all-but-forgotten wisdom drove him to destroy his own order...and create it anew from the ashes. As the last surviving Sith, Darth Bane promulgated a harsh new directive: the Rule of Two. </p> <p>Two there should be; no more, no less. </p> <p>One to embody the power, the other to crave it. </p> <p>Now Darth Bane is ready to put his policy into action, and he thinks he has found the key element that will make his triumph complete: a student to train in the ways of the dark side. Though she is young, Zannah possesses an instinctive link to the dark side that rivals his own. With his guidance, she will become essential in his quest to destroy the Jedi and dominate the galaxy. </p> <p>But there is one who is determined to stop Darth Bane: Johun Othone, Padawan to Jedi Master Lord Hoth, who died at Bane’s hands in the last great Sith War. Though the rest of the Jedi scoff at him, Joshua’s belief that there are surviving Sith on the loose is unshakeable. </p> <p>As Johun continues his dogged pursuit of the man who killed his master, Zannah, faced unexpectedly with a figure from her past, begins to question her embrace of the dark side. And Darth Bane is led by Force-induced visions to a moon where he will acquire astonishing new knowledge and power - power that will alter him in ways he could never have imagined....</p>",

Joe has been moving deeper into his study of ritual magic and further away from his combat team. He's learning more and more, but more often than not needs to choose between his research and squad leadership. Improving the town is a huge help to the guild, and they have been pushing to increase their power. Their rapid increases have not gone unnoticed. The guild receives an ultimatum, delivered by assassins and signed with blood. If they continue to accrue power and fame, each and every person with a grievance against the guild will come to smash the town back to square one. With tensions coming to a head, all Joe wants to do is leave it all behind and reach the next area. He flatly refuses the guild when they ask him to devise lethal options to use against the gathering army, but when the time comes...even Joe is unsure if he'll step into the limelight and show everyone exactly how ruthless he can be.",

The SADEs, self-aware digital entities, express to Alex Racine and Renée de Guirnon their desire to know the method of their creation. Alex and Renée, the Omnian co-leaders, want to obtain the knowledge for the SADEs, who are humans’ closest allies. Alex, Renée, and Julien, a friend and a SADE, board the giant city-ship, Freedom, which sails for Méridien, the home world of the far-reaching human colonies of the Confederation. They have a long overdue appointment with House Brixton, the Méridien group responsible for creating the SADEs. However, Shannon Brixton, the House Leader, is expected to zealously guard the secrets of the SADEs’ origination. While at Méridien, Alex receives an urgent message requesting help in alliance space, where a small group of Omnians and Earthers battle the Colony, a race of insectoids, which is subsuming planets.  To complicate matters, a rogue battleship fleet left the federacy, bypassed the human colonies, and is searching among the alliance worlds for a habitable planet. If an unoccupied world isn’t found, they’re prepared to evict the inhabitants by force. In the wake of Alex’s exit from Omnia for alliance space, Hector is left in charge of the Omnians’ second fleet. The SADE temporarily carries the mantle of protector of human colonies and allied worlds. For the Omnians, life and its challenges couldn’t be more precarious, or could they?",

Somehow her summoned heroes are all undead?</b></p> <p>How will the church react when their Saintess summons a skeleton in place of a mighty hero? Sofia isn’t too keen on finding out.</p> <p>In this world, Gods choose [Saints], and [Saints] summon [Heroes] from other worlds; everyone knows that. But Sofia had a thing for bones ever since she was a child; there’s only one [Class] she wants: [Necromancer]! When, by the whims of fate, she gets both classes at the same time, the system breaks.</p> <p>Two classes? That isn’t allowed!</p> <p>It cannot be! The system’s administrators would not let it go… If only they were still there.</p> <p>But they were not, and it was too late. Sofia saw an opportunity to abuse a loophole in the system, and she is just the kind of person who would try to stick her whole arm into said loophole if she could if only to see what happens.</p> <p>So, what has the system, running by itself with its mysterious creator missing, done to mend the error? The two classes fused into one.</p> <p>Sofia’s skills from the two classes were broken and mashed together. [Holy Light]? [Raise Skeleton]? What she receives is [Holy Skeleton] instead. But can she escape the Church’s grasp with her newfound powers, or is she destined to forever but some God’s pawn?</p> <p>Follow Sofia as she unknowingly gets tangled in power struggles far beyond what she had bargained for.</p> <p>With millions of views and thousands of followers, this was one of the most popular female-led web serials of 2023. Be ready for a wild ride as you experience the reworked and improved version of Sofia's Skeletal Shenanigans!</p> <p><b>Break a leg, skeleton!</b></p>",

    "description": "<p>When your fairy godmother threatens to enslave you with a curse - when a malevolent piper solves your rat problem but steals your children - when you seek revenge on the prince who turned you into a frog - who can you turn to in your hour of need? The band of scoundrels known far and wide as the Bastard Champions - the swashbuckling trio who travel a world of legend, seeking adventure and righting wrongs - as long as there's enough gold to be earned. They are Jack, the seemingly unkillable leader whose ever-present grin belies a dark past; Marie, who fights with fury but battles more fiercely to control the beast within; and Frank, the master of logistics, whose cloak hides horrific scars that are far more than skin-deep. As they slash and scheme through kingdom and village alike, the Bastard Champions uncover tantalizing clues to their ultimate quarry: the powerful Blue Fairy, who has made each of their lives a living hell. </p> <p><i>Second Hand Curses</i> adds a dash of sly wit and a heaping portion of action to the fairy tales you thought you knew. </p>",

He's part of a rogue superteam taking the world by storm and changing the dynamic for both heroes and villains alike. With change comes resistance, and those holding control and power are not ready to just hand it over without a fight.  For the former D-list supervillain, it's time to break out the spare synthmuscle, charge the massive railgun pistol, and bring the pain. With his new team, he thinks he can take on the world, but is Cal biting off more than he can chew? He must deal with sanctioned hero teams and power-mad bureaucrats on one side and the major supervillains of his world on the other.  As Cal and his allies ready themselves to face friend and foe, he will also have to deal with his relationship with Stacy Mitchell, also known as the Olympian, Aphrodite. Separated for more than a year, they've only just reunited and are faced with the prospect of being on opposite sides of the coming conflict. Can they find enough common ground between the secrets and half truths to sustain their fledgling relationship, or are they doomed like the last time to crash and burn?  Find out in Secrets of a D-List Supervillain. ",

Stripping osmium from across the stars, thieves will stop at nothing to fuel the nightmarish industry of Stolen Persons, their souls locked away in chips made of the rarest metal known.</p> <p>Among these thieves is Helum Gauss, the visionary criminal whose empire spans a hundred worlds. But his massive corporation, BeneStar, lost—badly—to Van and the Guild, and Gauss won’t take no for an answer.</p> <p>To that end, he’ll hit Van where it hurts the most: <i>Family.</i></p> <p>Lost among the Stolen Persons, Carter Yost is far from home, angry, and spoiling for a fight, and BeneStar is the perfect method for revenge on Van, the Guild, and the forces of justice. To BeneStar CEO Helem Gauss, murder isn’t a crime. It’s just part of doing business, and with a trillion bonds at stake, Gauss declares war on anyone who stands in his way of absolute authority.</p> <p>BeneStar tried guns. They tried missiles. They tried galactic media, and they still lost. Now, they’ll use an enraged soul captured between life and death, and one last weapon that frightens employees everywhere. The Human Resource Department.</p> <p>Gauss will unleash his most vicious division of bureaucrats, and a league of attorneys whose sole job is to crush opponents by any means necessary. BeneStar will fight in court, in the public forum, or in the depths of space, where laws and missiles can end a Peacemaker’s career forever. The mercenaries and pirates, all armed to the teeth, are an added bonus for BeneStar, whose navy ranks among the most powerful in known space.</p> <p>In a war for control of the hearts and minds of everyone in The Deeps, Van and his crew are going to win—or die trying.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Ruwen wants nothing more than to relax in the Third Secret and recover from the terrible damage to his core. Escaping the ambush in the Infernal Realm had come at a steep cost—one that means no Spirit use until he heals.</p> <p>Unfortunately, rest is one more thing that needs to wait, because the Bamboo Viper Master’s trial started days ago, and not participating results in the purging of his Step knowledge. Not something he wants to risk.</p> <p>Joining the trial holds extra danger for Ruwen because fighting the Infernal God forced him to use forbidden Shadow Clan knowledge, breaking an oath, and the Founders will certainly punish him. But he’s spent the last 18 months intensely training for the worst, so the peril doesn’t frighten him.</p> <p>What does make Ruwen pause is the chaos back home, because attending the Master’s trial will delay his return. But the Steps hold no more secrets from him, and finishing the testing quickly will be trivial. His homecoming will barely notice the delay.</p> <p>Entering the Master’s trial, Ruwen learns there are seven secrets, not six, and his assumptions quickly fall apart. The Founders deliver additional troubles, as the consequences of his broken oath spread further than he thought possible.</p> <p>Ruwen's seemingly straightforward trial may prove a trap, and instead of leaving a Master of the Bamboo Viper Step Clan, he may fail to unravel the mystery of the seventh step and spend eternity in the shadow’s darkness. Even if he survives it, the terrible judgment of the Founders awaits, and amid all this uncertainty an ancient relic delivers a misfortunate prophecy that if left unheeded declares death will surely find him.</p>",

I've woken up in worse places. Hmm. What does that say about my life choices?\" (Eric, amateur magician, part-time vampire, and accidental king) </p> <p>It's not easy being king. Especially when you've got an allergy to sunrise and sunset, a fire goddess for a mother-in-law, demonic adversaries, random assassins, and a basement full of insecurities to cope with. Add to that his daughter, the fire priestess/princess; a couple of lightly deranged professional magicians; a whole city full of wizards; and enough squabbling princes to resemble a kindergarten argument. It's enough to make a man want to just go home. Luckily for Eric, he has the world's fastest pet rock, a smart-mouthed sword, and a horse that not only understands him but likes him anyway. </p>",

    "description": "The Mistborn trilogy's heroes are now figures of myth and legend, even objects of religious veneration. They are succeeded by wonderful new characters, chief among them Waxillium Ladrian, known as Wax, hereditary Lord of House Ladrian but also, until recently, a lawman in the ungoverned frontier region known as the Roughs. There he worked with his eccentric but effective buddy, Wayne. They are \"\"twinborn,\"\" meaning they are able to use both Allomantic and Feruchemical magic.Shadows of Self shows Mistborn's society evolving as technology and magic mix, the economy grows, democracy contends with corruption, and religion becomes a growing cultural force, with four faiths competing for converts.This bustling, optimistic, but still shaky society now faces its first instance of terrorism, crimes intended to stir up labor strife and religious conflict. Wax and Wayne, assisted by the lovely, brilliant Marasi, must unravel the conspiracy before civil strife stops Scadrial's progress in its tracks.  Performed by Terence Aselford; Chris Genebach; Bradley Smith; Dani Stoller; Tracy Olivera; Yasmin Tuazon; Bob Payne; Eva Wilhelm; Richard Rohan; David Harris; Michael John Casey; Lily Beacon; Bruce Alan Rauscher; Chris Davenport; David Jourdan; Eric Messner; Laura C Harris; Thomas Keegan; Robbie Gay; Matthew Keenan; Maggie Donnelly; Rebecca Sheir; Jonathan Feuer; Nanette Savard; Kimberly Gilbert; Michael Glenn; Casey Platt; Rose Elizabeth Supan; Mort Shelby; Nick DePinto; Lise Bruneau; Christopher Scheeren; Gregory Wooddell; Evan Casey; Patrick Bussink; James Lewis; Colleen Delany; Ken Jackson; Eric Singdahlsen; James Konicek; Tim Carlin; Christopher Walker; Scott Graham; Dylan Lynch; Tony Nam; Scott McCormick; Thomas Penny.",

Neil Gaiman’s </b><b><i>American Gods</i></b><b> meets Jim Butcher’s Harry Dresden.”—</b><b><i>SFFWorld</i></b><br /> <br /> For nearly two thousand years, only one Druid has walked the Earth—Atticus O’Sullivan, the Iron Druid, whose sharp wit and sharp sword have kept him alive as he’s been pursued by a pantheon of hostile deities. Now he’s got company.<br /> <br /> Atticus’s apprentice Granuaile is at last a full Druid herself. What’s more, Atticus has defrosted an archdruid long ago frozen in time, a father figure (of sorts) who now goes by the modern equivalent of his old Irish name: Owen Kennedy.<br /> <br /> And Owen has some catching up to do.<br /> <br /> Atticus takes pleasure in the role reversal, as the student is now the teacher. Between busting Atticus’s chops and trying to fathom a cell phone, Owen must also learn English. For Atticus, the jury’s still out on whether the wily old coot will be an asset in the epic battle with Norse god Loki—or merely a pain in the arse.<br /> <br /> But Atticus isn’t the only one with daddy issues. Granuaile faces a great challenge: to exorcise a sorcerer’s spirit that is possessing her father in India. Even with the help of the witch Laksha, Granuaile may be facing a crushing defeat.<br /> <br /> As the trio of Druids deals with pestilence-spreading demons, bacon-loving yeti, fierce flying foxes, and frenzied Fae, they’re hoping that this time, three’s a charm.<br /> <br /> <b>Don’t miss any of The Iron Druid Chronicles:</b></p> <p><i>Hounded </i></p> <p><i>Hexed </i></p> <p><i>Hammered </i></p> <p><i>Tricked </i></p> <p><i>Trapped </i></p> <p><i>Hunted </i></p> <p><i>Shattered </i></p> <p><i>Staked </i></p> <p><i>Scourged </i></p> <p><i>Besieged</i></p>",

The more the better, really.</p> <p>The Six Sacred Swords are Kaldwyn’s most famous artifacts, forged as the only means to defeat the god beasts. Each sword must be earned by a worthy champion, and no single person has ever managed to collect them all.</p> <p>Not yet, at least. Keras is just getting started.</p> <p><i>Six Sacred Swords</i> is a lighthearted fantasy adventure inspired by Japanese game series like <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>, <i>Final Fantasy</i>, and <i>Fire Emblem</i>. It takes place in the same universe as the Arcane Ascension novels, but years earlier and with a different protagonist. While the books are interconnected, they can be listened to on their own in any order.</p> <p>For appendices with further details on the magic and characters, please download the supplementary PDF.</p>",

    "description": "Harry Dresden, Chicago's only professional wizard, is about to have a very bad day.…  Because as Winter Knight to the Queen of Air and Darkness, Harry never knows what the scheming Mab might want him to do. Usually, it’s something awful.  He doesn’t know the half of it.…  Mab has just traded Harry's skills to pay off one of her debts. And now he must help a group of supernatural villains - led by one of Harry's most dreaded and despised enemies, Nicodemus Archleone - to break into the highest-security vault in town, so that they can then access the highest-security vault in the Nevernever.  It's a smash-and-grab job to recover the literal Holy Grail from the vaults of the greatest treasure hoard in the supernatural world - which belongs to the one and only Hades, Lord of the freaking Underworld and generally unpleasant character. Worse, Dresden suspects that there is another game afoot that no one is talking about. And he's dead certain that Nicodemus has no intention of allowing any of his crew to survive the experience. Especially Harry.  Dresden's always been tricky, but he's going to have to up his backstabbing game to survive this mess - assuming his own allies don’t end up killing him before his enemies get the chance.…",

    "description": "\"Narrator Suzy Jackson's assured, brassy tones and forceful delivery are an exceptional match for Sanderson's high-stakes, battle-driven space opera.... Jackson's gift for characterizations shines - she brings out the humor and heroism in Spensa's young classmates and friends (and the neurotic spaceship MBOT), along with the pain and perseverance of the generations that came before them. This is a high-octane futuristic narrative of hope, sacrifice, and courage, and a fast pace speaks to the rising urgency as war rages above the planet. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award.\" (AudioFile magazine) From Brandon Sanderson, the number one New York Times best-selling author of the Reckoners series, Words of Radiance, and the internationally best-selling Mistborn series, comes the first book in an epic new series about a girl who dreams of becoming a pilot in a dangerous world at war for humanity's future.   Spensa's world has been under attack for decades. Now pilots are the heroes of what's left of the human race, and becoming one has always been Spensa's dream. Since she was a little girl, she has imagined soaring skyward and proving her bravery. But her fate is intertwined with her father's - a pilot himself who was killed years ago when he abruptly deserted his team, leaving Spensa's chances of attending flight school at slim to none.   No one will let Spensa forget what her father did, yet fate works in mysterious ways. Flight school might be a long shot, but she is determined to fly. And an accidental discovery in a long-forgotten cavern might just provide her with a way to claim the stars.",

No one's tried to kill Harry Dresden for almost an entire year, and his life finally seems to be calming down. For once, the future looks fairly bright. But the past casts one hell of a long shadow.  An old bargain has placed Harry in debt to Mab, monarch of the Winter Court of the Sidhe, the Queen of Air and Darkness - and she's calling in her marker. It's a small favor he can't refuse, one that will trap Harry Dresden between a nightmarish foe and an equally deadly ally, and one that will strain his skills-and loyalties-to their very limits.  It figures. Everything was going too well to last....  Please note: A few lines of text from one section of the original book are missing from this 2008 recording. This is the best available source audio from the publisher.",

BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.<br /> <br /> '<i>You should do things because they're right. Not because gods say so. They might say something different another time.</i>'<br /> <br /> Religion is a competitive business in the Discworld. Everyone has their own opinion and their own gods, of every shape and size - all fighting for faith, followers, and a place at the top.<br /> <br /> So when the great god Om accidentally manifests himself as a lowly tortoise, stripped of all divine power, it's clear he's become less important than he realised.<br /> <br /> In such instances, you need an acolyte, and fast. Enter Brutha, the Chosen One - or at least the only One available. He wants peace, justice and love - but that's hard to achieve in a world where religion means power, and corruption reigns supreme...<br /> <br /> <b>'An intriguing satire on institutionalized religion corrupted by power . . .' </b><b><i>Independent</i></b><b><br /> <br /> 'Deftly weaves themes of forgiveness, belief and spiritual regeneration' </b><b><i>The Times</i></b><br /> <br /> <i>You can listen to the Discworld novels in any order, but </i><b><i>Small Gods </i></b><i>is a standalone.</i><br /> <br /> <i>The first book in the Discworld series - </i><b><i>The Colour of Magic</i></b><i> - was published in 1983.

    "description": "<p>For nearly three decades, Terry Pratchett has enthralled millions of fans worldwide with his irreverent, wonderfully funny satires set in the fabulously imaginative Discworld, a universe remarkably similar to our own. From sports to religion, politics to education, science to capitalism, and everything in between, Pratchett has skewered sacred cows with both laughter and wisdom, and exposed our warts, foibles, and eccentricities in a unique, entertaining, and ultimately serious way. </p> <p>At long last, Lady Sybil has lured her husband, Sam Vimes, on a well-deserved holiday away from the crime and grime of Ankh-Morpork. But for the commander of the City Watch, a vacation in the country is anything but relaxing. The balls, the teas, the muck - not to mention all that fresh air and birdsong - are more than a bit taxing on a cynical city-born and -bred copper. </p> <p>Yet a policeman will find a crime anywhere if he decides to look hard enough, and it’s not long before a body is discovered, and Sam - out of his jurisdiction, out of his element, and out of bacon sandwiches (thanks to his well-meaning wife) - must rely on his instincts, guile, and street smarts to see justice done. As he sets off on the chase, though, he must remember to watch where he steps... This is the countryside, after all, and the streets most definitely are not paved with gold. </p> <p>Hailed as the “purely funniest English writer since Wodehouse” (<i>Washington Post Book World</i>), with a “satirist’s instinct for the absurd and a cartoonist’s eye for the telling detail” (<i>Daily Telegraph</i>, London), Terry Pratchett offers a novel of crime, class, prejudice, and punishment that shows this master at his dazzling best.</p>",

    "description": "Artifice, the great enemy, has been defeated. The sister SADEs, Omnian sentient digital entities, are free from their boxes. Most humans are unaware that the sisters have duplicated themselves many more times than suspected. They now constitute a sizable, powerful group, calling themselves the Sisterhood. The elimination of Artifice’s rule should be a time of relief and recovery for Alex Racine’s Omnian fleet and for the Toralians, whose home world was Artifice’s lair. Instead, it’s a chaotic period. Visitors appear, sailing the distinct, black-hulled Toralian battleships. Five colonial governors wish to witness the recovery of the ancient home world. President Sargut welcomes them, but Alex is suspicious about the governors’ motives. In a face-to-face meeting, it becomes clear that the governors have a dark, ulterior purpose. With the release of the federacy from Artifice’s reign, word reaches the Omnians that races are embracing their newfound freedom. Some enjoy peace, some desire expansion, and some yearn for revenge.  The races’ latter choices mean danger for the Toralians and Alex’s fleet. Powerful battleship fleets are either sailing for the Toralian home world to exact reprisals, or they’re seeking new territory. Every encounter presents a challenge for the Omnian fleet. Some fleets have crossed the federacy’s boundary and are headed toward humankind’s worlds. Alex and the Omnians face a difficult choice. They must choose whether to defend the Toralian home world, which is forming a nascent society, or chase the fleets that are headed toward their planets.",

    "description": "Sol's warships paid the ultimate price for threatening the Haraken and New Terran worlds. Now, Haraken president Alex Racine and his Méridien partner, Renée de Guirnon, are engaged in a desperate gamble to stop a war between their worlds and United Earth's (UE) massive forces before it starts.  What's Alex's grand plan? He hasn't a clue, but his people believe in him and hope he will find a way to protect them. Alex does have powerful assets: the Haraken space fleet; the genius SADEs, mobile Haraken digital intelligences; and the defected UE scientists, who are providing a wealth of intelligence about their home world.  Arriving at Sol, Alex discovers the perfect opportunity to make his statement to the UE Supreme Tribunal in the form of the aging Idona Station, which has fallen into disrepair as UE militia and rebels battle for control. Alex explains his unorthodox plan when he says, \"The UE tribunes will succumb when we overpower them with prosperity.\"  The Harakens work to meld Idona's militia, stationers, and rebels into the Haraken's view of the world, one based on peace, purpose, and equality. The Tribunal is at odds over the Harakens' interference in their system, forcing the rifts in the UE's political structure to widen into chasms.  In the exciting conclusion to Haraken, the series' previous book, Sol is the story of a clash of cultures and ideals as Earthers struggle to find a way toward a successful new future. ",

BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.<br /> <br /> <b>'This didn't </b><b><i>feel</i></b><b> like magic. It felt a lot older than that. It felt like music.'</b><br /> <br /> Being sixteen is always difficult, but it's even more so when there's a Death in the family. Susan hasn't exactly had a normal upbringing, with a skeletal grandfather who rides a white horse and wields a scythe.<br /> <br /> When Death decides he needs a well-earned break, he leaves Susan to take over the family business. The only problem is, everyone mistakes her for the Tooth Fairy...<br /> <br /> Well, not the only problem. There's a new, addictive music in Discworld. It's lawless. It changes people. It's got a beat and you can dance to it.<br /> <br /> It's called Music With Rocks In. And it won't fade away...<br /> <br /> The Discworld novels can be listened to in any order, but <i>Soul Music</i> is the third book in the Death series.<br /> <br /> The first book in the Discworld series - <i>The Colour of Magic </i>- was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.<br /> <br /> </p>",

    "description": "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin.</b><br /> <br /> <b>Over 1 million Discworld audiobooks sold – discover the extraordinary universe of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld like never before</b><br /> <br /> The audiobook of <i>Sourcery</i> is read by Colin Morgan (<i>Merlin</i>; <i>Testament of Youth</i>;<i> Belfast</i>). BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.<br /> <br /> <b>'It's vital to remember who you really are . . . it isn't a good idea to rely on other people or things to do it for you, you see. They always get it wrong.'</b><br /> <br /> An eighth son of an eighth son is born, a wizard squared, a source of magic. A sourcerer.<br /> <br /> Unseen University, the Discworld's most magical establishment, has finally got its wish: the emergence of a wizard more powerful than ever before. You'd think they would have been a little more careful what they wished for . . .<br /> <br /> As the sourcerer takes over the University and sets his sights on the rest of the world, only one wizard manages to escape his influence. Unfortunately for everyone, it's Rincewind.<br /> <br /> Once again the cowardly wizard must embark on a quest: to deliver a precious artefact - the very embodiment of magic itself - halfway across the Disc to safety. If he doesn't make it, the death of all wizardry is at hand.<br /> <br /> And the end of the world, depending on who you listen to.<br /> <br /> <i>Sourcery </i>is the third book in the Wizards series, but you can listen to the Discworld novels in any order.<br /> <br /> The first book in the Discworld series - <i>The Colour of Magic</i> - was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.<br /> <br /> <b>'May well be considered his masterpiece . . . Humour such as his is an endangered species' </b><b><i>The Times</i></b><br /> <br /> <b>'One of our greatest fantasists, and beyond a doubt the funniest' George R.R. Martin</b></p>",

    "description": "Discover Space Force, the number one Audible best-selling novel by New York Times best seller Jeremy Robinson, and ask yourself, \"Who thought this was a good idea?\" Five years ago, the US Space Force became a reality. And while those writing the checks took things very seriously, the other military branches did not. As a result, Space Force was populated by undesirables: men and women who made too many mistakes, didn't follow the rules, or...slept with the wrong general's daughter. Three times. On camera. It was a mistake, okay? My name is Captain Ethan Stone, a decorated member of SEAL Team Six turned Space Force \"recruit\". While the powers-that-be attempted to make Space Force an embarrassment, they also sent some of the very best minds, fighters, and pilots to the program, because sometimes the best of us decide to take a stand against those same powers. Yeah, yeah. Not me. Though I seem to recall I was standing when...sorry. It's a distracting memory. Flash forward five years and between tenses. President West is in office. Power has shifted. And Space Force is defunded. With just a handful of us still living on base, we find ourselves being evicted. But before all of us can leave, aliens invade. Really ugly ones, too. Super nasty. I don't think I could describe them here without getting the audiobook banned. Anywho, using their advanced technology, they seal off Space Force Command behind a shrinking force field and kick off a battle royale to the death. Human vs. alien. To the victors goes the Earth. While my boy Frank Taylor and I throw down inside the force field, my main squeeze, First Lieutenant Jennifer Hale, leads an international strike team into freakin' space. It's nuts. Crazy action. Super funny, too, in like a Deadpool way, if that's your thing. The only way to really know what went down is to snag a copy of this audiobook and listen to it for yourself...before it's too late. Or wait for the movie. There is going to be a movie, right?",

The coordinates lead the team to Funworld, a planet-sized theme park with a worrying number of artificially intelligent clownbots, and a shocking disregard for Health & Safety.   With no weapons, and a shapeshifter who can no longer shift shape, Space Team's quest to unlock Funworld's mysteries leads them deep into the planet's core - and to the horrors that inhabit it - where they uncover the shocking secret Mech had no idea he was keeping.   Featuring space clowns, the second-last human alive, and at least one fleeting reference to Scooby Doo, Space Team: Planet of the Japes is the seventh hilarious audiobook in the internationally best-selling Space Team series.

    "description": "The galaxy just called for help. Unfortunately, the wrong man answered.When small-time conman, Cal Carver, is thrown in jail and forced to share a cell with a semi-naked cannibalistic serial killer, he's pretty sure his day can't get any worse. Boy, is he wrong. It isn't until two-thirds of the human race is wiped out and Cal is mistakenly abducted by aliens that things really start to go downhill.Whisked across the galaxy, Cal is forced into a team of some of the sector's most notorious villains and scumbags and tasked with delivering a package to a warlord-run solar system where the authorities daren't venture. The mission should be simple enough, but as one screw-up leads to another the ragtag group of unwitting heroes find themselves in a frantic battle to save an entire alien civilization - and its god - from total annihilation.Performed by Phil Thron, Danny Gavigan, Carolyn Kashner, Darius Johnson, Yasmin Tuazon, Bradley Smith, Henry W.

    "description": "<p>A collection of short stories gathered from the far reaches of the Space Team Universe. The spectacular tales of space adventure you'll find in this full cast audiobook are:</p> <p>\"\"Dead Men Don't Get Paid\"\"</p> <p>Undead detective, Dan Deadman, has a problem. He has a number of them, in fact. He's missing an arm. He needs money to repair his broken window. Someone has opened a portal to the hell-like Malwhere in a nightclub, filling the place with slavering flesh-eating monsters. Fortunately, Dan's diminutive house guest, Artur, has a plan to help him fix at least one of these problems, but like everything else in Dan's afterlife, nothing quite works out the way it should. A brand new Dan Deadman Space Detective adventure, set in the aftermath of Dial D for Deadman.</p> <p>\"\"Space Team: The Holiday Special\"\"</p> <p>Die Hard meets The Nativity in Space! It's Space Christmas Eve, and all through the space station not a creature was stirring except a load of evil space pirates who are trying to kidnap a very special newborn baby so it can be eaten by their pirate king. They hadn't counted on Cal Carver and the Space Team, though, who happen to be on the station for some much needed R &amp; R. Originally published in December 2016 as a standalone short story.</p> <p>\"\"The Last Bounty\"\"</p> <p>Once the baddest bounty hunter in the galaxy, all Konto Garr wants these days is a quiet family life with the woman he loves, and the respect of Deenia, the step-daughter who hates his guts. But when Deenia is taken hostage, Konto must employ all his skills to mount a death-defying rescue mission. With a terrorist-filled station between him and the hostages, and an infuriatingly upbeat boy from Deenia's class for company, Konto's talents will be stretched to their limit as he goes after the most important bounty of his life—his daughter. Originally published as part of the comedy sci-fi anthology, \"\"Pew Pew—Sex, Guns, Spaceships.... Oh My!\"\"</p> <p>\"\"Nun Shall Pass\"\"</p> <p>Former Nun, Ronda Sallas, is on a mission to save her son, Narp, from himself. And also from some evil Xandrie gangsters who have tricked him into helping them steal a weapon of mass destruction. Mostly from them, actually. Fortunately, Ronda's time at the convent has left her more than capable to deal with a few dozen gangsters, but when an Anti-Nun strips her of her precognition powers, things suddenly become more difficult. First published in The Expanding Universe—Volume 2 anthology.</p> <p>\"\"Splurt Home Alone\"\"</p> <p>An all-new short solo adventure starring everyone's favorite adorable green blob, Splurt.</p> <p>Performed by:</p> <p>The Holiday Special.</p> <p>Phil Thron as Narrator, Danny Gavigan as Cal, Carolyn Kashner as Loren, Darius Johnson as Mech, and Yasmin Tuazon as Mizette. With additional performances by Joe Mallon, Marni Penning, Bradley Foster Smith, Eric Messner, Ken Jackson, Michael John Casey, Nathanial Perry, Richard Rohan, Rob McFadyen, Steve Wannall and Scott McCormick.</p> <p>Dead Men Don’t Get Paid.</p> <p>Phil Thron as Narrator, Alysia Beltran as Ollie, Stewart Crank as Artur, Ian Putnam as the Announcer and Mort Shelby as Deadman. With additional performances by Rose Elizabeth Supan, Eric Messner, Ken Jackson, Tyler Hyrchuk and Scott McCormick.</p> <p>The Last Bounty.</p> <p>Phil Thron as Narrator, Wyn Delano as Konto, Tyler Hyrchuk as Larry and Richard Rohan as Captain.

    "description": "<p>Accidental space adventurer Cal Carver has had a rough few months. He's fought spider-dragons, battled space clowns, and been repeatedly tortured by the galaxy's oldest assassin.<br /> <br /> And don't even get him started on the squirrel-tits.<br /> <br /> Now all that's behind him, Cal just wants to kick back and relax. The universe, however, has other ideas.<br /> <br /> He and his crew find themselves in possession of the Symmorium Sentience, a once god-like entity now stripped of its power. The Sentience needs help to return home and restore the Symmorium species, which recently found itself the subject of an unfortunate genocide.<br /> <br /> But with dark forces seeking to turn the Sentience's power into a planet-pulverizing weapon, the team's trek across the galaxy becomes a desperate race against time, with the fate of the very cosmos at stake.<br /> <br /> Featuring awkward space-dates, gene-splicing villains, and a packet of coconut fingers as old as time itself, Space Team: Sentienced to Death is the eleventh book in the bestselling Space Team series by multi-award-winning author Barry J. Hutchison, and perfect for fans of funny stuff happening in space.<br /> <br /> Performed by Phil Thron, Danny Gavigan, Carolyn Kashner, Darius Johnson, Yasmin Tuazon, Christopher Walker, Stephanie Németh-Parker, Marni Penning, Laura C.

    "description": "It isn't just war. It's space war! Geronimus Krone, the most dangerous man in existence, has altered the course of time, appointed himself King of Space, and now rules the galaxy with the help of his four monstrous generals and their armies.  Cal Carver and his crew are the galaxy's only hope. But, reeling from their recent loss, they can't stop Krone on their own. Fortunately, they've got a whole bunch of friends they can call on for help.  With Krone's grip tightening around thousands of helpless star systems, a much larger Space Team must find a way to crush his armies, defeat his generals, and finally face off against the King of Space himself.  But first, they've got a funeral to attend.... Featuring implausible time travel, the Four Horsemen of the Spacepocalypse and the return of Tobey Maguire.

    "description": "Cal Carver's time is about to run out.  He and his space team are broke. Forced to take low-paying gun-for-hire jobs just to keep the food replicator working, their prospects are not looking good.   When they pick up a distress signal from a luxury space cruiser, they think their luck might be about to change. And it does; sadly, not in the way they'd hoped.   Someone has detonated a time bomb aboard the cruiser - an experimental device designed to shatter time itself. As the team passes through the fragments, their personal timelines begin moving at very different speeds, and an ageing Cal is forced to live out decades aboard the ship surrounded by his now statuelike crewmates and the mutated, inbred descendants of the cruiser's former inhabitants.   As if that isn't bad enough, the time bomb was just a test for the real weapon - a weapon that could spell a fate worse than death for Space Team and the enslavement of the entire galaxy.   Featuring giant space babies, reverse mermaids, and the most dangerous man in existence, Space Team: The Time Titan of Tomorrow is the eighth fast and frantic adventure in the Space Team comedic sci-fi series.

To some, he is a do-or-die war hero. To the other half of the galaxy, he’s a pariah. Forced into retirement, he has resettled on Talca Four where he’s now Deputy VP of Corporate Security, protecting a high-tech military company on the corporate battlefield - at least, that’s what the job description says. Really, he’s just there to impress clients and investors. It’s all relatively low risk - until he’s entrusted with new orders. A breach of a competitor’s computer network has Butler’s superiors feeling every bit as vulnerable. They need Butler to find who did it, how, and why no one’s taken credit for the ingenious attack.</p> <p>As accustomed as Butler is to the reality of wargames - virtual and otherwise - this one screams something louder than a simple hack. Because no sooner does he start digging when his first contact is murdered, the death somehow kept secret from the media. As a prime suspect, he can’t shake the sensation he’s being watched...or finally succumbing to the stress of his past. Paranoid delusion or dangerous reality, Butler might be onto something much deeper than anyone imagined. But that’s where Butler thrives.</p> <p>If he hasn’t signed his own death warrant.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The world waits for no one. While Boxxy is off chasing shinies and delving dungeons abroad, Azurvale's shadows churn, fester, and ferment into a potent cocktail of trouble. Secret organizations maneuver behind the scenes, patiently advancing their nefarious plots. Government agencies lay in wait, ready to pounce at the first sign of trouble. Powerful adventurers gear up and train for the next challenge, uncertain as to what form it might take. In the midst of all this, a humble scholar arrives from a distant land wholly ignorant to the mountain-sized powder keg waiting for him. Explosives primed and the fuse set, the only thing missing is a spark to set things off, and who better to serve that role than a fiery redhead making her triumphant return?</p> <p>It would appear that the universe once again conspires to put the Hero of Chaos in dire straits. However, in this particular instance, Boxxy is not entirely without fault. It doesn't know it yet, but the nasty surprises that await it are nothing more than the consequences of its own actions. As it turns out, butting heads with the seedy underbelly of civilized society has a way of stirring up an immense amount of trouble. Boxxy is aware of this, of course, though it doesn't care since it fancies itself an expert at deflecting blame and avoiding responsibility. For the most part, this is an accurate assessment. Unfortunately for the less-than-a-year-old monster, it has yet to learn one of life's key lessons.</p> <p>Bad karma is like a stubborn stain—it never truly goes away.</p> <p><b>Content warning</b>: Profanity, gore, violence, explicit adult content</p>",

    "description": "<p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i></b><b>BESTSELLER • In the eighth book in The Iron Druid Chronicles, two-thousand-year-old Druid Atticus O’Sullivan faces the clan of vampires who have been bent on</b> <b>destroying him—including Leif, his former best friend turned enemy.</b><br /> <br /> When a Druid lives as long as Atticus does, he’s bound to run afoul of a few vampires—make that legions of them. Even his former friend and legal counsel turned out to be a bloodsucking backstabber. Now the toothy troublemakers—led by power-mad pain-in-the-neck Theophilus—are no longer content to live undead and let live. Atticus needs to make a point—and drive it into a vampire’s heart.<br /> <br /> As always, Atticus wouldn’t mind a little backup. But his allies have problems of their own. Ornery archdruid Owen Kennedy is having a wee bit of troll trouble: Turns out when you stiff a troll, it’s not water under the bridge. Meanwhile, Granuaile is desperate to free herself of the Norse god Loki’s mark and elude his powers of divination—a quest that will bring her face-to-face with several Slavic nightmares.<br /> <br /> As Atticus globe-trots to stop his vampire nemesis, the journey leads to Rome. What better place to end an immortal than the Eternal City? But poetic justice won’t come without a price: In order to defeat Theophilus, Atticus may have to lose an old friend.<br /> <br /> <b>Don’t miss any of The Iron Druid Chronicles:</b><br /> <b><i>HOUNDED</i></b><b> | </b><b><i>HEXED</i></b><b> | </b><b><i>HAMMERED</i></b><b> | </b><b><i>TRICKED</i></b><b> | </b><b><i>TRAPPED</i></b><b> | </b><b><i>HUNTED</i></b><b> | </b><b><i>SHATTERED</i></b><b> | </b><b><i>STAKED</i></b><b> | </b><b><i>SCOURGED</i></b><b> | </b><b><i>BESIEGED</i></b></p>",

Malgus brought down the Jedi Temple on Coruscant in a brutal assault that shocked the galaxy. But if war crowned him the darkest of Sith heroes, peace would transform him into something far more heinous - something Malgus would never want to be, but cannot stop, any more than he can stop the rogue Jedi fast approaching.  Her name is Aryn Leneer - and the lone Knight that Malgus cut down in the fierce battle for the Jedi Temple was her Master. And now she’s going to find out what happened to him - even if it means breaking every rule in the book. ",

    "description": "BioWare and LucasArts - creators of the hugely popular Star Wars®: Knights of the Old Republic® video game - have combined their storytelling talents and cutting-edge technology for an innovative new massively multiplayer online role-playing game that allows players to create their own personal Star Wars adventure 3,500 years before the rise of Darth Vader. Now number one New York Times best-selling author Sean Williams brings the world of the game to life in his latest novel, Star Wars: The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance. Tassaa Bareesh, a matriarch in the Hutt crime cartel, is holding an auction that’s drawing attention from across the galaxy. Representatives of both the Republic and the Sith Empire are present, along with a Jedi Padawan sent to investigate, a disenfranchised trooper drummed out of the Republic’s elite  Blackstar Squad, and a mysterious Mandalorian with a private agenda. But the Republic’s envoy is not what he seems, the Empire’s delegate is a ruthless Sith apprentice, the Jedi Padawan is determined to do the right thing and terrified that he can’t, the trooper hopes to redeem her reputation, and the Mandalorian is somehow managing to keep one step ahead of everyone. None of these guests - invited or uninvited - have any intention of participating in the auction. Instead they plan to steal the prize, which is locked inside an impregnable vault: Two burned chunks of an exploded star cruiser, one of which may hold the key to the wealth of an entire world. But the truth about the treasure is dangerous and deadly. And in the end, Sith and Jedi, Republic and Empire, must do something they’ve never done before, something that all the agents of good and evil could never make them do: Join together to stop a powerful threat that could destroy the galaxy.",

The rumours of his cowardice are true - he deserted his flight during battle against the Krell. Worse, though, he turned against his team and attacked them.  Spensa is sure there's more to the story. And she's sure that whatever happened to her father in his starship could happen to her. When she made it outside the protective shell of her planet, she heard the stars - and it was terrifying. What she learned turned her world upside down. Everything Spensa's been taught is a lie.   But Spensa also learned a few things about herself - and she'll travel to the end of the galaxy to save humankind if she needs to.",

To make matters worse, they trigger an ominous light that appears in the sky, and provoke the native wildlife. Though saved from disaster, the survivors learn they’ve moved out of the frying pan and into the fire.</p> <p>\"Safe and secure,\" the stranded crew find themselves the newest shareholders aboard an old space station controlled by an intelligence keen on reviving a long derelict company. As a team, they’re forced to accept their new identities as the only intern workers aboard the station and take on its numerous quests while searching for a way home—or risk defaulting on their newly acquired debt and becoming fabricator food or indentured servants. But first, they need to get the station working again.</p> <p>Among the crew is Sky: a young woman who has been chasing a mystery surrounding her sister her whole life and thinks this off-the-books mission is the lead she’s been looking for. Sky’s investigation heats up, revealing a situation worse than she ever could have imagined.</p> <p>To protect themselves and uncover the mysteries of the station, everyone must give 110%. There is no better time than now, no better place to be, and no home like your home away from home. Giving up is not an option.

Ten years ago, Calamity came. It was a burst in the sky that gave ordinary men and women extraordinary powers. The awed public started calling them Epics. </p> <p>But Epics are no friend of man. With incredible gifts came the desire to rule. And to rule man you must crush his will. </p> <p>Nobody fights the Epics...nobody but the Reckoners.

    "description": "<p><b>Cyborg samurai Cat LeBlanc takes charge when aliens overrun a city—only to discover humans may be the greater threat—in this cyberpunk adventure.</b></p> <p>A small city mostly populated by well-to-do retirees, Burlington, Vermont, is now home to the Antithesis. The alien flora has taken root underground and throughout the surrounding woodlands, giving birth to monstrous beings driven by instinct to consume Earth's own living creatures. With only three rookie samurai to protect them and resources dwindling fast, the people of Burlington are facing extinction.</p> <p>Cat LeBlanc's success against the Antithesis in the megacity of New Montreal has raised her profile amongst the samurai. And despite her antiauthoritarian attitude and appetite for destruction in combat, she's been assigned to assume command of Burlington's defenses. Against her better judgment—and though it means taking time away from her girlfriend, Lucy, and their adopted gang of children, \"the kittens\"—Cat accepts the mission.</p> <p>Accompanied by pyrotechnic nun Gomorrah, Cat finds Burlington's downtown is indeed struggling to survive, but the privileged residents of River Heights thrive behind the protection of their privately funded militia. Worse, the undisciplined trio of samurai-in-training she's supposed to lead are variously arrogant, rebellious, and insecure. Now, Cat must forge a fighting force out of them while playing politics with the city's wealthiest power brokers.</p> <p>Unfortunately, their enemy doesn't also suffer from political and personal conflicts. The Antithesis is of one mind, a hive determined to spread their contagion across Earth. And if Cat can't rally the samurai, soldiers, and citizens of Burlington to work together, the fall of the city may foretell humanity's eventual fate . . .</p> <p><b>The fifth volume of the hit LitRPG sci-fi series—with more than nine million views on Royal Road—now available on Audible and wherever ebooks are sold!</b></p>",

The city's infrastructure is in disrepair, and the politicians and corporations responsible for its maintenance have been slacking off, leaving angry citizens to fend for themselves.</p> <p>Cat LeBlanc is supposed to be on vacation, spending time with her girlfriend, Lucy, and their clowder of adopted children, affectionately known as \"the kittens.\" Unfortunately for the young samurai, duty calls, requiring her to take a more active role in addressing the city's woes. Cat has no patience for political games or corporate bureaucracy, and she'd prefer to spend her time supporting a nonprofit clinic by producing free prosthetics to help those in need.</p> <p>But samurai tech has far greater value on the black market, enticing depraved gangs to loot the clinic. As Cat and fellow samurai Gomorrah follow the twisted trail of thievery, they learn they're not the only ones trying to track down the stolen goods. Rac, the teenage \"kitten\" living with Cat, has joined a crew of mercenaries looking to make a big score—only to find themselves the targets of a private military company.</p> <p>Now it's up to Cat to get Rac out of harm's way and uncover who was really behind the prosthetic theft, all while the Antithesis prepares another invasion . . .</p> <p><b>The sixth volume of the hit LitRPG sci-fi series—with more than 17 million views on Royal Road—now available on Audible and wherever ebooks are sold!</b></p>",

    "description": "From number one best-selling author Brandon Sanderson and Janci Patterson comes the first of three Skyward series novellas, each told from the perspective of a different member of the team back on Detritus. Listen to FM's story between Starsight and Cytonic. When a planet-destroying Delver suddenly appears in the sky of Detritus and vanishes just as suddenly, FM knows that the last free human society got lucky. Her Skyward Flight companion, Spensa, figured out how to draw this Delver away, but it won’t be so easy next time. The forces of the Galactic Superiority will be back - and if the Defiant Defense Force can’t figure out a way to escape the planet, humanity’s destruction is only a matter of time. Spensa’s mission to infiltrate the Superiority unveiled the secret to their hyperdrives - a cytonic slug species called the Taynix. Now FM’s flightleader, Jorgen, has found a large group of Taynix hiding in the caverns far below Detritus’s surface. FM and Jorgen must work together with the engineer Rig to awaken the mysterious alien Alanik and unlock the powers of the Taynix, or humanity will be trapped. With Spensa’s friend Minister Cuna of the Superiority stranded at the outpost of Sunreach, they need to figure out how to rescue them - or the Superiority government will be in the sole clutches of those who want to wipe out Detritus once and for all.

With one of their own gone and another under serious investigation, none of the former Powereds knows how many days remain for them in the Hero Certification Program.</p> <p>The time they do have will be filled with more trials and classes, honing their skills as they work toward the increasingly difficult goal of becoming Heroes. Ample new challenges await them, and not all of them can be met on the safety of Lander’s campus. Fallout from last year’s final exam has stirred the interest of many parties, not all of them friendly.</p> <p>With enemies pressing in from all directions, it’s going to take new alliances, dedication, and countless hours of training if they want to last another year.</p> <p>Performed by Jonathan Lee Taylor, Robb Moreira, Rana Kay, Darius Johnson, Matthew Bassett, Megan Poppy, Holly Adams, Tanja Milojevic, James Konicek, Zeke Alton, Rayner Gabriel, Dan Delgado, Carolyn Kashner, Nanette Savard, James J.

The new classes will test their minds, bodies, and determination in ways never anticipated. In a year filled with the unveiling of secrets, unexpected entanglements, and, of course, super-powered battles, who will be left standing is anyone’s guess.

One that he sought out after he’d come back from his tour of duty.</p><p>That was before Melody, a contractor, more or less blew his life up as if it were a building packed full of C-4. Then she pranced around the ashes of it like it was the end of the world and was conjuring up the end times herself. All while breaking in a rookie by the name of Vanessa into the PID. A gung-ho and eager young detective looking to prove herself. Then commandeering and recruiting a cleaning lady who turned out to be an elven dryad sorceress who viewed killing people as little more than emptying the trash can.</p><p>Gus had lived through it, though. Made it work for him and had come out of it without too many new scars. An adventure that he hadn’t wanted any part of...that involved the Fed being blown up, a stadium full of Paras all going into a feral rage, and breaking off a plot hatched by what felt like an organization that rivaled the Fed.&nbsp;</p><p>Which apparently was all in a day’s work, right up until they fired you for doing that work because you made the brass look bad.</p><p>Without a job, more people relying on him than ever, and no direction, Gus is going to have to put on his big boy pants and figure something out. And soon.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a good thing that he’s a boogieman. Because, being an apex predator that made the entirety of the paranormal world fear him was something he could fall back on. He could lean into it and make it work for him.&nbsp;</p><p>He’d done it before when he was in the military. Made a name for himself out there in the bloody desert. He was \"The Hunter\". A name that the elven mothers now used to instill fear into misbehaving children. A name that grown men and women wouldn’t discuss in polite company. Except, despite Gus’s best intentions to get back to his stable nonlife, he’s going to get thrown right back into the fray. Whether he likes it or not, he’s about to be handed a new problem that’s going to mess up what little remained of his life.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, his past was going to catch up to him and meet up with his future.</p><p><strong>Warning and minor spoiler: This novel contains graphic violence, undefined relationships/harem, unconventional opinions/beliefs, and a hero who is as tactful as a dog at a cat show.

    "description": "<p>Syl was given a choice by Gramps when they died. Reincarnate as a regular person or embark on a daring experiment. Driven by a desire to honor Gramps and a sense of adventure, Syl chose the latter... only to awaken as a lowly slime.</p> <p>A farmed slime.</p> <p>The life of a farmed slime was cruel. Syl was constantly at the mercy of humans, a slime whose only purpose was to eat and recycle garbage. The threat of lethal core-destroying knives wielded by innocent children was a constant shadow. This was not the life Syl had envisioned. So, they made a daring escape to the wilderness!</p> <p>Along the way, Syl discovered the joy of eating everything they encountered. But the local monsters weren't too thrilled with another creature moving in. Humans, dwarves, and elves see monsters as nothing but experience. Goblins see Syl as an exploitable resource.</p> <p>With the odds stacked against Syl, the question of their survival loomed large. Could they not just survive but thrive? Could they unlock new magic and integrate new slime cores? The future was a vast, uncharted territory, but Syl was unwavering in their determination to explore it, no matter the challenges that lay ahead.</p> <p>And the biggest question of all—</p> <p>Can Syl make any friends?</p>",

But if there’s an ethical corporation out there, Murderbot has yet to find it, and if Barish-Estranza can’t have the planet, they’re sure as hell not leaving without something.

Whatever it was, I got involved in the magical world again and started getting myself a reputation.  Alex Verus’s insights into the future used to be the best-kept secret in London. Now, with the aid of his apprentice, Luna, his unique investigative talents are all the rage. He just has to be careful about picking his employers, because everyone - even the beautiful woman who practically begs him to run security for a prestigious tournament - has motives that can be hard to predict. And Alex doesn’t do unpredictable.  But his latest gig just might be impossible. Apprentices have been vanishing without a trace - and someone on the Council could be involved. Alex has no evidence, no witnesses, and no suspects. All he knows is that someone is keeping tabs on him. And after assassins target Luna’s classmate, Alex sees that he doesn’t know the half of it - and that he could be the next to disappear. ",

    "description": "Talus, the system comprised of Toralians and the Sisterhood, is under siege. Massive battleships, each ferrying an envoy from a federacy race, surround the Talusian home world Toral. Two wedges, each comprised of nine federacy battleships, wait outside the system. The sisters, whom the SADEs created during the fight to defeat Artifice, possess advanced tech. They construct warships, the vaunted Tridents, to protect their new society. However, despite the support of the enormous Toralian battleships, the nascent Talusian fleet is no match for the numerous ships that ring the planet. The envoys’ lists of demands against the Talusians are long, and the envoys compete to be heard, complicating the negotiations. The chaotic conditions buy the Talusian president Sargut time to send an urgent plea for help. His message requests the assistance of the Omnian fleet.  The city-ship Our People and two Trident commands make preparations to sail for Talus to relieve the beleaguered Talusians. But the fleet must solve a dire local emergency before it can get underway. Nata, a new lieutenant, makes a terrible misstep. She visits Sawa, the Dischnya home world. Her investigation results in her capture by an underground nest. Now the Omnians must recover Nata before she comes to harm. A shocking discovery is made on Sawa, and Nata’s rescue becomes a race to save a dying Sawa nest. Omnian Dischnya take matters into their own hands, freeing the fleet to sail. Having resolved one exigent issue, the fleet arrives at Talus only to confront a much greater problem.",

Now unshackled, the System alters the cosmic order, creating rifts leading to fragments of destroyed universes. These rifts, brimming with strange artifacts and untold powers, present a tantalizing yet perilous opportunity for those brave enough to explore them.</p> <p>Amidst this chaos, the Harbinger quest emerges—a role laden with immense power, destined for only one. This is unwelcome news for Ruwen, who already carries the burden of restoring Spirit to the universe. The rifts provide a path for other deities to rapidly augment their powers, threatening the delicate equilibrium and placing Ruwen’s plans in jeopardy.</p> <p>Torn between universe-threatening tasks and personal desires, Ruwen grapples with the consequences of his choices. One friend lies unconscious, critically injured by Ruwen’s actions, while another mysteriously disappears from the battlefield, clutching the sword that pierced her body.</p> <p>Among these critical priorities, Ruwen must lead. To survive seemingly unending conflict, the country requires sweeping changes, including guilds, multi-classing, and a merit system. Ambitious town-building projects are set to reshape the country’s cities into defendable fortresses.</p> <p>When the inevitable attack arrives, Ruwen's decision to spring an obvious trap in order to save a friend leads to catastrophic consequences, threatening his friends, his allies, and potentially hurtling the universe toward ultimate destruction.</p> <p>\"The Ninth Harbinger\" follows Ruwen, a Divine Apostasy, in his relentless pursuit of balance in a universe teetering on the brink of annihilation.</p>",

Little do they know that colony will become permanent–and the last stand of the human race. Because, without warning, every single person left on Earth simply...vanishes.

Following the unprecedented outcome of the siege at Fort Yimin, both the Republic and the Empire are forced to drastically reevaluate their plans for the conflict. With matters on the western front more or less settled for the moment, the warring nations turn their attention toward the eastern theatre. Winter looms on the horizon, threatening to deadlock the region and put a temporary halt to hostilities. With both sides planning to deploy bold and unconventional strategies on top of committing vast resources, it’s anyone’s guess which of them will come out on top.</p> <p>Indeed, neither government is shying away from resorting to underhanded, questionable, or downright amoral means. The Gilded Hand has been stepping up their efforts to further Spymaster Edward Allen’s schemes. The Empire’s intelligence agency is also looking to field its most powerful enforcers in the coming battles. The Republic’s Foreign Intelligence Bureau is having a hard time keeping up, but they are not without their own dirty tricks. Rumors within the royal palace of the Horkensaft Kingdom to the east suggest that the dwarves and gnomes are on the verge of aiding the elven nation. Something that wouldn’t have been made possible without the Republic’s deep coffers, and the less-than-reputable individuals that fill them.</p> <p>Boxxy T. Morningwood isn’t one of those shady contributors. If anything, it’s been steadily draining the government’s resources as it forces them to pay exorbitant fees to resolve issues that the monster itself creates. A trend it plans to keep following for as long as it can lie, cheat, and murder its way through life.</p> <p>Which, barring something ridiculous like divine intervention, is poised to be a very long time indeed.</p> <p><b>Content warning</b>: Profanity, gore, violence, explicit adult content.</p>",

Lavella Hemoesta, the owner of Maverick, met with him to work out a deal so her company wouldn't be given bad press. That meeting changed the future for both Lavella and Zander.</p> <p>After a few false starts, including a multiple homicide in a hedge maze, the pair finally found time for intimate fun. Zander flipped the script on Lavella, making the Vampire prey instead of the predator, firmly setting their budding relationship in stone. After the whirlwind sex, Zander proposed a crazy idea that set the stage for something unseen by galactic society: a mecha tournament.</p> <p>During the tournament, Zander led his team to victory using his training as a military contractor. In doing so, he flouted the training left by the Antecedents, but his squad won handily every time. Some of the losing squads took it badly, but none as badly as Smaztil Hammish, the lead pilot of Proud Axe. When the Dwarven pilots lost, they physically attacked Zander's at the end of the tournament.</p> <p>With the tournament over and a party waiting, the crew stopped only long enough to try collecting their bets. The organized crime group who'd taken the bet refused to pay up. Instead of a bloody confrontation, Zander just forwarded the video evidence to the magistrates and they left the gang behind.</p> <p>What would come from Zander's flagrant disregard of the Antecedents' training? Would the criminal organization take umbrage at being called out? Only time will tell…</p>",

Rifts happen, so you should be ready when universes collide. A policy with Stranger & Stranger can cover all of your interdimensional insurance needs. Rated \"Number One in Customer Satisfaction\" for three years running, no claim is too big or too weird for Tom Stranger to handle.  But now Tom faces his greatest challenge yet. Despite being assigned the wrong - and woefully inadequate - intern, Tom must still provide quality customer service to multiple alternate Earths, all while battling tentacle monsters, legions of the damned, an evil call center in Nebraska, and his archnemesis, Jeff Conundrum. Armed with his Combat Wombat and a sense of fair play, can Tom survive? And will Jimmy the Intern ever discover his inner insurance agent?  It's time to kick ass and adjust claims.  Adam Baldwin (Firefly, Chuck) performs Larry Correia's madcap interdimensional tale of underwriting and space travel, where the only thing scarier than tentacle monsters is a high deductible. ",

Since time immemorial the Spires have sheltered humanity, towering for miles over the mist-shrouded surface of the world. Within their halls aristocratic houses have ruled for generations, developing scientific marvels, fostering trade alliances, and building fleets of airships to keep the peace.  Captain Grimm commands the merchant ship Predator. Fiercely loyal to Spire Albion, he has taken their side in the cold war with Spire Aurora, disrupting the enemy's shipping lines by attacking their cargo vessels. But when the Predator is severely damaged in combat, leaving captain and crew grounded, Grimm is offered a proposition from the Spirearch of Albion - to join a team of agents on a vital mission in exchange for fully restoring Predator to its fighting glory.  And even as Grimm undertakes this dangerous task, he will learn that the conflict between the Spires is merely a premonition of things to come. Humanity’s ancient enemy, silent for more than ten thousand years, has begun to stir once more. And death will follow in its wake.... ",

    "description": "Three hundred years after the events of the Mistborn trilogy, Scadrial is on the verge of modernity, with railroads to supplement the canals, electric lighting in the streets and the homes of the wealthy, and the first steel-framed skyscrapers racing for the clouds.Kelsier, Vin, Elend, Sazed, Spook, and the rest are now part of history or religion. Yet even as science and technology are reaching new heights, the old magics of Allomancy and Feruchemy continue to play a role in this reborn world. Out in the frontier lands known as the Roughs, they are crucial tools for the brave men and women attempting to establish order and justice.One such is Waxillium Ladrian, a rare Twinborn who can Push on metals with his Allomancy and use Feruchemy to become lighter or heavier at will. After twenty years in the Roughs, Wax has been forced by family tragedy to return to the metropolis of Elendel. Now he must reluctantly put away his guns and assume the duties and dignity incumbent upon the head of a noble house. Or so he thinks, until he learns the hard way that the mansions and elegant tree-lined streets of the city can be even more dangerous than the dusty plains of the Roughs.

After a few days of this, it was amazing how glad people were to see the kid with his magical rat pipe. And they were amazing when the rats followed hint out of town.</i> </p> <p>They'd have been really amazed if they'd ever found out that the rats and the piper met up with a cat somewhere outside of town and solemnly counted out the money. </p> <p>The Amazing Maurice runs the perfect Pied Piper scam. This streetwise alley cat knows the value of cold, hard cash and can talk his way into and out of anything. But when Maurice and his cohorts decide to con the town of Bad Blinitz, it will take more than fast talking to survive the danger that awaits. For this is a town where food is scarce and rats are hated, where cellars are lined with deadly traps, and where a terrifying evil lurks beneath the hunger-stricken streets...</p> <p>Set in Terry Pratchett's widely popular Discworld, this masterfully crafted, gripping listen is both compelling and funny. When one of the world's most acclaimed fantasy writers turns a classic fairy tale on its head, no one will ever look at the Pied Piper or rats the same way again! </p>",

To avoid war, Earth's government must find an equally unusual object: A type of sheep (\"The Android's Dream\"), used in the alien race's coronation ceremony. </p> <p>To find the sheep, the government turns to Harry Creek, ex-cop, war hero and hacker extraordinaire, who with the help of Brian Javna, a childhood friend turned artificial intelligence, scours the earth looking for the rare creature. And they find it, in the unknowing form of Robin Baker, pet store owner, whose genes contain traces of the sheep DNA. But there are others with plans for the sheep as well: Mercenaries employed by the military. Adherents of a secret religion based on the writings of a 21st century science-fiction author. And alien races, eager to start a revolution on their home world and a war on Earth. </p> <p>To keep our planet from being enslaved, Harry will have to pull off the greatest diplomatic coup in history, a grand gambit that will take him from the halls of power to the lava-strewn battlefields of alien worlds. There's only one chance to get it right, to save the life of Robin Baker - and to protect the future of humanity.</p>",

For 2,000 years, they've hidden the truth about human evolution. They've also searched for an ancient enemy - a threat that could wipe out the human race. Now the search is over. </p> <p>Off the coast of Antarctica, a research vessel discovers a mysterious structure buried deep in an iceberg. It has been there for thousands of years, and something is guarding it. As the Immari rush to execute their plan, a brilliant geneticist makes a discovery that could change everything. </p> <p>Dr. Kate Warner moved to Jakarta, Indonesia to escape her past. She hasn't recovered from what happened to her, but she has made an incredible breakthrough: a cure for autism. Or so she thinks. What she has found is far more dangerous - for her and the entire human race. Her work could be the key to the next stage of human evolution. In the hands of the Immari, it would mean the end of humanity as we know it. </p> <p>Agent David Vale has spent 10 years trying to stop the Immari. Now he's out of time. His informant is dead. His organization has been infiltrated. His enemy is hunting him. But when David receives a coded message related to the Immari attack, he risks everything to save the one person that can help him solve it: Dr. Kate Warner. </p> <p>Together, Kate and David must race to unravel a global conspiracy and learn the truth about the Atlantis Gene...and human origins. Their journey takes them to the far corners of the globe and into the secrets of their pasts. The Immari are close on their heels and will stop at nothing to obtain Kate's research and force the next stage of human evolution - even if it means killing 99.9% of the world's population. David and Kate can stop them...if they can trust each other. And stay alive.</p>",

    "description": "<p> <b>A PANDEMIC 70,000 YEARS IN THE MAKING WILL CHANGE HUMANITY...FOREVER.</b> </p> <p>In Marbella, Spain, Dr. Kate Warner awakens to a horrifying reality: the human race stands on the brink of extinction. A pandemic unlike any before it has swept the globe. Nearly a billion people are dead--and those the Atlantis Plague doesn't kill, it transforms at the genetic level. A few rapidly evolve. The remainder devolve. </p> <p>As the world slips into chaos, radical solutions emerge. Industrialized nations offer a miracle drug, Orchid, which they mass produce and distribute to refugee camps around the world. But Orchid is merely a way to buy time. It treats the symptoms of the plague but never actually cures the disease. </p> <p>Immari International offers a different approach: do nothing. Let the plague run its course. The Immari envision a world populated by the genetically superior survivors--a new human race, ready to fulfill its destiny. </p> <p>With control of the world population hanging in the balance, the Orchid Alliance and the Immari descend into open warfare. Now humanity's last hope is to find a cure, and Kate alone holds the key to unraveling the mystery surrounding the Atlantis Plague. The answer may lie in understanding pivotal events in human history--events when the human genome mysteriously changed. Kate's journey takes her across the barren wastelands of Europe and northern Africa, but it's her research into the past that takes her where she never expected to go. She soon discovers that the history of human evolution is not what it seems--and setting it right may require a sacrifice she never imagined. </p>",

    "description": "With The Alloy of Law and Shadows of Self, Brandon Sanderson surprised readers with a New York Times bestselling spinoff of his Mistborn books, set after the action of the trilogy, in a period corresponding to late 19th-century America.Now, with The Bands of Mourning, Sanderson continues the story. The Bands of Mourning are the mythical metalminds owned by the Lord Ruler, said to grant anyone who wears them the powers that the Lord Ruler had at his command. Hardly anyone thinks they really exist. A kandra researcher has returned to Elendel with images that seem to depict the Bands, as well as writings in a language that no one can read. Waxillium Ladrian is recruited to travel south to the city of New Seran to investigate. Along the way he discovers hints that point to the true goals of his uncle Edwarn and the shadowy organization known as The Set.

On his adventures, Arthur discovers a strange magical blade that responds to the dragon’s will inside him, befriends a powerful young conjurer whose past is shrouded in mystery, and battles the deadly Elderwood Guardian. Yet all his efforts might prove for naught when Arthur makes an enemy of a talented conjurer from a very powerful family, putting his very future at risk.</p>",

Until one of the former Unseen planets shifts in orbit - a small thing, but worth looking into. Close to this erratic world, something incredible opens, revealing a connection to stars so distant that they have no name on the Cygnus charts.</p> <p>The Black Gate pulses in and out of existence, and when a massive pair of alien warheads comes through and destroys an entire orbital facility, Dash is left with no choice but to pick up the mantle of Messenger and fight once more. He must go through the gate, find out who is responsible, and eliminate the threat at any cost.</p> <p>But this is beyond anything he and his people have faced before...and it will take everything they have to stand against it.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The ancient magic of wizards was anything but dark. It was the enlightenment that lifted humanity from the squalor of superstition, and the worship of fell spirits and capricious gods, but those days are gone. The shining glory of the sorcerers burned away the subtlety of wisdom, replacing it with easy power, held only in the hands of the elite - a new age built upon the elemental supremacy of aristocrats and the ignorance of the masses.</p> <p>But this will change, for the greatest power comes with knowledge, and the deeper teachings of wizardry have not been utterly lost. The last wizard of the old tradition still survives in solitude, nursing tired grudges and waiting for death.</p> <p>His passing might have gone unnoticed, but for the imposition of a youth too stubborn to accept his refusal to take an apprentice. With a new student comes new hope, and that hope has caused old powers to stir again. That the world will change is inevitable, but the shape of the future is anything but certain.</p>",

It was alive and glowing and vibrant and it was the undisputed pigment of the imagination . . .'<br /> <br /> Somewhere between thought and reality exists the Discworld, a magical world not totally unlike our own. Except for the fact that it travels through space on the shoulders of four giant elephants who in turn stand on the shell of an astronomically huge star turtle, of course.<br /> <br /> Rincewind is the world's worst wizard who has just been handed a very important job: to look after the world's first tourist, upon whose survival rests the peace and prosperity of the land. Unfortunately, their journey across the Disc includes facing robbers, monsters, mercenaries, and Death himself.<br /> <br /> And the whole thing's just a game of the gods that might send them over the edge . . .<br /> <br /> You can listen to the Discworld novels in any order, but <i>The Colour of Magic </i>is the first book in the Wizards series.<br /> <br /> <i>The Colour of Magic</i> is the first book in the Discworld series and was published in 1983.

The Interdependency is in jeopardy due to the collapse of various planets in the empire. Powerful families are looking out for their own interests, even if that means killing their enemies and threatening the empire. Wheaton delivers an expressive narration using a humorous tone when needed and employing his acting talent to bring the characters to life. This audiobook is a treat not only for Wheaton's fans but also for anyone who is into well-written science fiction.\" (<i>AudioFile</i> magazine) </p> <p><i>The Consuming Fire</i> - the sequel to the 2018 Hugo Award Best Novel finalist and 2018 Locus Award-winning <i>The Collapsing Empire</i> - an epic space-opera novel in the best-selling Interdependency series, from the Hugo Award-winning and <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author John Scalzi.</p> <p>The Interdependency, humanity’s interstellar empire, is on the verge of collapse. The Flow, the extra-dimensional conduit that makes travel between the stars possible, is disappearing, leaving entire star systems stranded. When it goes, human civilization may go with it - unless desperate measures can be taken. </p> <p>Emperox Grayland II, the leader of the Interdependency, is ready to take those measures to help ensure the survival of billions. But nothing is ever that easy. Arrayed before her are those who believe the collapse of the Flow is a myth - or at the very least, an opportunity that can allow them to ascend to power. </p> <p>While Grayland prepares for disaster, others are preparing for a civil war, a war that will take place in the halls of power, the markets of business and the altars of worship as much as it will take place between spaceships and battlefields. The Emperox and her allies are smart and resourceful, but then so are her enemies. Nothing about this power struggle will be simple or easy...and all of humanity will be caught in its widening gyre. </p> <p>The Interdependency series: </p> <p></p> <ol> <li><i>The Collapsing Empire</i></li> <li><i>The Consuming Fire</i></li> </ol>",

    "description": "The only way out is to die... Few know the warship’s actual name. Fewer still know what it really is. And almost no one knows of its unique ability, an ability that could tilt the balance of power if not outright win the war. But everyone has heard the rumors. Rumors about the worst place the Planetary Union Fleet can send you. Rumors of a ship with an eighty percent crew mortality rate. In these hushed, fearful whispers, the ship does have a name. People call it “the Crypt,” because those aboard are as good as dead. The PUV James Keeling can do something no other vessel in existence can do—slip into another dimension, travel undetected, then re-emerge onto our plane and surprise enemy targets. But the thing that makes the Crypt unique also makes it a nightmare for those onboard; interdimensional travel causes hallucinations, violent behavior, and psychotic breakdowns. Keeling could be the Union’s greatest weapon, a game-changing asset that can defeat the bloodthirsty zealots of the Purist Nation, the Union’s mortal enemy. If, that is, the brass can find the right crew. But with those dark rumors traveling at lightspeed throughout Fleet, sailors with connections, with favors to call in, or those with careers on the rise pull any string they can to avoid being assigned to the Crypt. The brightest and best shield themselves from this top-secret craft, yet the brass must send it out on critical missions. As the war drags on and casualties pile up, Fleet crews the ship by assigning the worst of the worst. If you are convicted of assault, fraud, cowardice, theft, rape, murder—or you cross the wrong Admiral—you may find yourself aboard the Crypt. Most are given a choice: serve a two-year stint on the Keeling and have your record expunged, or be executed for your crimes. Welcome to the PUV James Keeling, where the only way out… is to die. #1 New York Times Bestseller Scott Sigler returns with this highly anticipated Military Sci-Fi series, THE CRYPT. It's BATTLESTAR GALACTICA meets EVENT HORIZON in this tale of service and solitude. Pre-order your copy today!",

    "description": "From New York Times and number one Audible best-selling duo Jeremy Robinson and R.C. Bray comes a horrifying revelation about the centuries-old Three Days of Darkness prophecy, during which the legions of Hell will be unleashed on Earth.... There shall come over the whole Earth, an intense darkness lasting three days and three nights.  Miah Gray is a 27-year-old former army soldier living in rural New Hampshire with his sister, mother, and her boyfriend. He is plagued by PTSD, finding solace, but not redemption, with the aid of prescribed cannabis. All he wants to do is get high, relax with a good sandwich, and watch a meteor shower with his neighborhood crush, Jen. He who opens his window or door out of curiosity, or leaves his home, will fall dead on the spot.  When the sun's light is blotted out the following morning and the world is plunged into darkness, Miah finds himself locked down with his family, covering windows with trash bags, lighting candles, and following the arcane rules of an ancient prophecy. But there is no escaping what comes next. The air will be infected by demons, appearing in all sorts of hideous forms.  A brilliant flash of light fills the sky, leaving Miah changed and an Old Norse death rune etched onto his forehead. He fears he has been marked for death until the neighborhood's parents start disappearing and he's left behind. Leading Jen and a ragtag group of parentless kids, Miah hunts for answers and for their parents while trying to keep his sister safe. He charges headlong down a path that will take him to the gates of Hell...and then straight through. All of Hell will be let loose.  The Dark is a mind-bending, character-driven sci-fi-infused horror novel like no other.",

But can she survive the dire straights she finds herself in, as she guards humanity from enemies within and without?</p> <p>Listen to it because....</p> <p>Luce Spinoza comes into her own, with the weight of her lord’s fate sitting heavy on her shoulders, while pushing forward with their mission. With enemies closing in on all sides, she must choose a path for herself.</p> <p>The story:</p> <p>The Throneworld is in turmoil, wracked by the opening of the Great Rift and the failure of the Astronomican. Inquisitor Erasmus Crowl, his mind and body ravaged by what he has seen in the Hollow Mountain, is missing, taking with him the clues to the conspiracy that has come to obsess him. Luce Spinoza, his interrogator, must choose whether to seek him out or defend her diminished realm from the many forces that still seek to destroy it. As enemies circle, Interrogator Spinoza enters a race against time to find the evidence she needs. But with the fate of humanity itself hanging in the balance, she must decide what lengths she is willing to go to in order to uncover the truth.</p> <p>Written by Chris Wraight. Narrated by John Banks. Running time 10 hours, 30 minutes (approx).</p>",

Emmy-nominated actor Zachary Quinto—best known for his roles as the Nimoy-approved Spock in the <i>Star Trek</i> reboot and the menacing, power-stealing serial killer Sylar in <i>Heroes</i>—brings his well-earned sci-fi credentials and simmering intensity to this genre-bending thriller.</p> <p>One day, not long from now, it becomes almost impossible to murder anyone—999 times out of a thousand, anyone who is intentionally killed comes back. How? We don't know. But it changes everything: war, crime, daily life.</p> <p>Enter Tony Valdez, professional Dispatcher. True to their name, these licensed assassins are tasked with humanely disposing of people in death’s crosshairs to offer them a second chance at avoiding the reaper. When a friend and fellow Dispatcher goes missing, Valdez is plunged into a web of intrigue both professional and personal.</p> <p>It's a race against time for Valdez to find his friend before it's too late...before not even a Dispatcher can save him. </p>",

    "description": "A wildly exciting journey through a world remade, The Divide combines real characters with horrifically realized creations, pitting the worst of human nature against the strength of family. Equal parts action, horror, and moving drama that only Jeremy Robinson can pull off. When the divide is crossed...  No one remembers how the Divide was created. The miles-deep and miles-wide chasm has existed for hundreds of years, protecting what remains of humanity from the Golyat: a creature whose shadow moves across the horizon at sunset.  Davina, daughter of Jesse, is a shepherd. She spends her days guiding herds of deer through the forests of New Inglan, protecting them from predators, herding them away from the Divide, and ensuring the tribe of Essex has meat when needed. While many shepherds die in their first year - from the elements, from injury, or in the jaws of a wolf - Davina is resilient. Having just slain a mountain lion, Davina returns to her village to discover a hunting party has been sent out in search of the Modernists, a group fascinated with the past, the technology that once filled the world, and what lies beyond the Divide. To keep the Modernists from reaching the Divide's far side and revealing humanity's presence to the Golyat, the hunters will torture and kill them all. Including Davina's teenage son.  Davina strikes out, intending to ensure her son's death will be quick and without torture. Reaching the island of Boston first, Davina confronts the Modernists and finds herself incapable of taking her son's life. Captured by the enemies of Essex, she is transported across the Divide along with her son and the Modernists.  For the first time in 500 years, humanity steps foot on the Divide's far side. Stranded with the enemy, Davina must fight to keep them all alive, herding people instead of deer, while uncovering the truth about humanity's past and her connection to events that reshaped the world.",

An impossibly complicated subway system built out of the world's subterranean railway systems, all combined and then tied together into a knot. Up is down. Down is up. Close is far. The cars are filled with monsters, the railway stations are less than safe, and the exit is always just a few stops away. But there is hope. For the first time, the crawlers are all working together.

    "description": "<p>Hugo Award-winning author John Scalzi returns to his best-selling Old Man's War universe with <i>The End of All Things</i>, the direct sequel to 2013's <i>The Human Division</i>. </p> <p>Humans expanded into space...only to find a universe populated with multiple alien species bent on their destruction. Thus was the Colonial Union formed, to help protect us from a hostile universe. The Colonial Union used the Earth and its excess population for colonists and soldiers. It was a good arrangement...for the Colonial Union. Then the Earth said: no more. </p> <p>Now the Colonial Union is living on borrowed time - a couple of decades at most before the ranks of the Colonial Defense Forces are depleted and the struggling human colonies are vulnerable to the alien species who have been waiting for the first sign of weakness to drive humanity to ruin. And there's another problem: a group, lurking in the darkness of space, playing human and alien against each other - and against their own kind - for their own unknown reasons. </p> <p>In this collapsing universe, CDF Lieutenant Harry Wilson and the Colonial Union diplomats he works with race against the clock to discover who is behind attacks on the Union and on alien races, to seek peace with a suspicious, angry Earth, and to keep humanity's union intact...or else risk oblivion and extinction - and the end of all things. </p>",

Defeated, both physically and mentally, and with no way of making it back to the known world, Riven comes to terms that he is by all means retired. No more soldiering, it's back to basics. With his first tamed monsters, an exploring Slime and a giant Spider, Riven sets out to build a home for himself and thrive in this strange land. Taming monsters, building homes, refining fruits, breeding slimes--erm, wait, no one's supposed to know that last one. Ahem, it's a whole new life for Riven Wrangleman. Meanwhile, the land's biggest and most beautiful secret waits for someone to come rouse her. Should she return, the world will be forever changed. Riven's world most of all.

And now, those people are dangling above his head. A mouse woman, a bat woman, and three anthropomorphic camel people, these five Demons bring with them incredible new glimpses into the state of the world for those lost on the island, namely Riven, Lucerein, and Enkriah. The new information is all well and good, but it doesn't change Riven's goals. He's still being slowly poisoned by the island, and his camp could still use some improvements. No amount of world-shaking revelations will alter that. The new visitors are a welcome change-of-pace, for sure, but it doesn't change the everyday life of Riven the Monster Rancher... Except Enkriah is intent on making it known that Riven is King of the Monsters, and with that comes friction. A former foot soldier, a former demon lord, an undead elf, a sacred priestess, and her loyal guardians... Surely, they can all get along under the banner of the newly declared King.",

    "description": "Brandon Sanderson, fantasy's newest master tale spinner, author of the acclaimed debut Elantris, dares to turn a genre on its head by asking a simple question: What if the hero of prophecy fails? What kind of world results when the Dark Lord is in charge? The answer will be found in the Mistborn Trilogy, a saga of surprises and magical martial-arts action that begins in Mistborn.For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the \"\"Sliver of Infinity,\"\" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison. Kelsier \"\"snapped\"\" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot.But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets, and gotten it. She will have to learn to trust, if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed.

    "description": "Step into the fold. It's perfectly safe.  The folks in Mike Erikson's small New England town would say he's just your average, everyday guy. And that's exactly how Mike likes it. Sure, the life he's chosen isn't much of a challenge to someone with his unique gifts, but he's content with his quiet and peaceful existence. That is until an old friend presents him with an irresistible mystery, one that Mike is uniquely qualified to solve.  Far out in the California desert, a team of DARPA scientists has invented a device they affectionately call the Albuquerque Door. Using a cryptic computer equation and magnetic fields to \"fold\" dimensions, it shrinks distances so a traveler can travel hundreds of feet with a single step. The invention promises to make mankind's dreams of teleportation a reality. And, the scientists insist, traveling through the door is completely safe. Yet evidence is mounting that this miraculous machine isn't quite what it seems - and that its creators are harboring a dangerous secret.  As his investigations draw him deeper into the puzzle, Mike begins to fear there's only one answer that makes sense. And if he's right, it may be only a matter of time before the project destroys...everything. A cunningly inventive mystery featuring a hero worthy of Sherlock Holmes and a terrifying final twist you'll never see coming, The Fold is that rarest of things: a genuine pause-resister science-fiction thriller. Step inside its audio and learn why author Peter Clines has already won legions of loyal fans. ",

They're young, they're fast and strong, and they're totally without normal human qualms.<br /> <br /> The universe is a dangerous place for humanity—and it's about to become far more dangerous. Three races that humans have clashed with before have allied to halt our expansion into space. Their linchpin: the turncoat military scientist Charles Boutin, who knows the CDF's biggest military secrets. To prevail, the CDF must find out why Boutin did what he did.<br /> <br /> Jared Dirac is the only human who can provide answers—a superhuman hybrid, created from Boutin's DNA, Jared's brain should be able to access Boutin's electronic memories. But when the memory transplant appears to fail, Jared is given to the Ghost Brigades.<br /> <br /> At first, Jared is a perfect soldier, but as Boutin's memories slowly surface, Jared begins to intuit the reason's for Boutin's betrayal. As Jared desperately hunts for his \"father,\" he must also come to grips with his own choices. Time is running out: The alliance is preparing its offensive, and some of them plan worse things than humanity's mere military defeat…</p>",

Not that he wanted <i>that</i> exactly. He just hated everything and everyone and wanted to be left alone. So as a big baddie, he's tried to hold back on the pure-evil schtick and make life a little better for his people—without being a total wuss, of course.</p> <p>But sometimes baddies gotta be bad. And now Seiji has found himself caught in a military, political, and possibly genocidal conflict with goblins. Historically (albeit wrongly) considered lowly pests, they've gathered under the banner of a self-proclaimed king. And that means all-out war to the last man . . . or goblin, as it were.</p> <p>It also may offer Seiji the opportunity to create an unstoppable weapon to use against his nemesis: the insufferably good-hearted, noble, super-freaking-annoying Yoshi, the \"Hero.\" The little twerp will never see it coming. <i>Muahahahahahahaaaa!</i></p> <p><b>The third volume of the hit fantasy adventure series—with more than five million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>",

Not only has the introduction of a Neurological Control Unit allowed for the manipulation of abilities, but it also provides something that will change the very nature of how the Proctans view death - and something that Milton, as a gamer, knows very well: respawning. </p> <p>But will those advantages be enough against the threat coming their way? </p> <p>Contains LitRPG/GameLit elements such as level progression and experience, optional tables, no harems, and a heavy Dungeon Core emphasis. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>",

    "description": "<p>\"Are there any questions?\" The final line in Margaret Atwood's modern classic, <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>, has teased and perplexed fans since the book's original release more than 30 years ago. Now, in this Audible Original production, listeners get some of the answers they've waited so long to hear. </p> <p>Featuring an all-new interview with Professor Piexoto, written by Atwood and performed by a full cast, <i>The Handmaid's Tale: Special Edition</i> is a must-listen for both fans and newcomers alike. Emmy Award winner Claire Danes (<i>Homeland</i>, <i>Temple Grandin</i>) gives a stirring performance of this classic in speculative fiction, where the message (and the warning) is now more timely than ever. In addition to rich sound design that honors the audio origins of Atwood's classic, the special edition also includes a brand-new afterword from the author and an essay written by author Valerie Martin (<i>Mary Reilly</i>, <i>Property</i>). </p> <p>After a violent coup in the United States overthrows the Constitution and ushers in a new government regime, the Republic of Gilead imposes subservient roles on all women. Offred, now a Handmaid tasked with the singular role of procreation in the childless household of the enigmatic Commander and his bitter wife, can remember a time when she lived with her husband and daughter and had a job, before she lost everything, even her own name. Despite the danger, Offred learns to navigate the intimate secrets of those who control her every move, risking her life for mere glimpses of her former freedom, and records her story for future listeners. </p> <p>Whether you're a fan of the original novel or someone who has recently discovered it, <i>The Handmaid's Tale: Special Edition</i> will shock, impress, and satisfy all those who listen. </p> <p><i>The Handmaid's Tale: Special Edition</i> features performances by Claire Danes, Margaret Atwood, Emily Bauer, Allyson Johnson, Gabra Zackman, Suzanne Toren, Tim Gerard Reynolds, Jennifer Van Dyck, Ray Porter, Emily Cox, Lauren Fortgang, Dan Reiss, Prentice Onayemi, Therese Plummer, and Mark Boyett. </p>",

    "description": "Who is the Hero of Ages?To end the Final Empire and restore freedom, Vin killed the Lord Ruler. But as a result, the Deepness---the lethal form of the ubiquitous mists---is back, along with increasingly heavy ashfalls and ever more powerful earthquakes. Humanity appears to be doomed.Having escaped death at the climax of The Well of Ascension only by becoming a Mistborn himself, Emperor Elend Venture hopes to find clues left behind by the Lord Ruler that will allow him to save the world. Vin is consumed with guilt at having been tricked into releasing the mystic force known as Ruin from the Well. Ruin wants to end the world, and its near omniscience and ability to warp reality make stopping it seem impossible. She can‚Äôt even discuss it with Elend lest Ruin learn their plans!The conclusion of the Mistborn trilogy fulfills all the promise of the first two books. Revelations abound, connections rooted in early chapters of the series click into place, and surprises, as satisfying as they are stunning, blossom like fireworks to dazzle and delight. It all leads up to a finale unmatched for originality and audacity that will leave readers rubbing their eyes in wonder, as if awaking from an amazing dream.

    "description": "Sick of the stress, aggravation, and multiple genocides they've had to put up with lately, accidental space hero Cal Carver and his crew set off to start a new life in a distant corner of the galaxy. Six tedious days of warp-speed and board games later, they arrive in a sector filled with new hope, new opportunities, and new adventures. Too broke to take advantage of any of these things, they are forced to accept a series of increasingly demeaning jobs just to make ends meet. When one such job leads them to the offices of a sector-wide TV network, Cal signs-up to star in smash-hit gameshow, The Hunt, confident of winning the big cash prize. What he fails to realize is that the show's premise involves him being chased and killed for the amusement of the viewing public and so Cal must run, fight, and occasionally beg for his life as he attempts to win the game, the money, and his freedom. But in the entire history of the show, no competitor has ever survived The Hunt, and the network will stop at nothing to keep that record intact... Featuring unexpected stabbings, maniacal puppets, and a dog with a head like a testicle. Space Team: The Hunt for Reduk Topa is the twelfth book in the internationally bestselling series from award-winning author, Barry J. Hutchison, and perfect for fans of Guardians of the Galaxy, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and The Golden Girls. Performed by Phil Thron, Danny Gavigan, Carolyn Kashner, Darius Johnson, Yasmin Tuazon, Christopher Walker, Amanda Forstrom, Cody Roberts, Laura C.

Yet together, they may hold the secret to saving the necron race....</p> <p><b>Listen to it because: </b>explore a story told across the millennia that delves deep into a pair of fascinating necron characters, their relationship and their plans for the galaxy.</p> <p><b>The story: </b>before the being called the Emperor revealed himself, before the rise of the aeldari, before the necrontyr traded their flesh for immortal metal, the world was born in violence. Even when they inhabited bodies of flesh, Trazyn the Infinite and Orikan the Diviner were polar opposites. Trazyn, a collector of historical oddities, presides over a gallery full of the most dangerous artefacts - and people - of the galactic past. Orikan, a chronomancer without peer, draws zodiacs that predict and manipulate the future. But when an artefact emerges that may hold the key to the necrons’ next evolution, these two obsessives enter a multi-millennia game of cat and mouse that ends civilisations, reshapes timelines, and changes both forever. As riddles unwind and ancient secrets are revealed, the question remains: will their feud save the necron race or destroy it?</p> <p>Written by Robert Rath. Narrated by Richard Reed.</p>",

That is, until Jamie makes a delivery to an old acquaintance, Tom, who works at what he calls “an animal rights organization”. Tom’s team needs a last-minute grunt to handle things on their next field visit. Jamie, eager to do anything, immediately signs on.</p> <p>What Tom doesn't tell Jamie is that the animals his team cares for are not here on Earth. Not our Earth, at at least. In an alternate dimension, massive dinosaur-like creatures named Kaiju roam a warm and human-free world. They're the universe's largest and most dangerous panda, and they're in trouble.</p> <p>It's not just the Kaiju Preservation Society who's found their way to the alternate world. Others have, too. And their carelessness could cause millions back on our Earth to die. </p>",

Fortunately, using his drones and multiple Molecular Converters to clean up the rubble, Milton was able to piece together everyone who had fallen under the Bearilla’s assault.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the force that had attacked him on his home turf was only a very small portion of those heading inevitably closer to the Kingdom’s border. After the beating that they had just taken, Milton, Rosewyn, Moxwell, Brint, Whisp, and the rest of the Guardian Guild knew that even with access to the Station Core’s dungeon, they wouldn’t be able to save the entire Kingdom all by themselves.</p> <p>Therefore, they must do all they can to delay the northern army of Bearillas and Quizards, knowing all the while that time was not on their side. Meanwhile, other plans are hatched to bend the citizenry to their cause; however, Milton and the others are not the only ones devising plans - the Cordpower Company still has it out for the Guild.</p> <p>But will their efforts be enough to save everyone? Only the brave actions of the Proctans - and Milton’s Combat Units, of course - will determine that, as various plans come to fruition as The Kingdom Rises.</p> <p>Contains LitRPG and GameLit elements such as level progression and experience, optional tables, no harems, and a heavy Dungeon Core emphasis.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio. </b></p>",

Audible's Customer Favorite of the Year!  Number one audiobook 2017. Welcome my friends!  Welcome...to “The Land\"! The battle of the dead was won, but at a great cost. Sion, leader of the Mist Village, was left with only pain and regret as Richter was claimed by the abyss.  What no one but the abandoned chaos seed knows is that he narrowly avoided the curse of the lich Singh, a curse that still hangs above his head. Now, surrounded by miles of darkness and tons of crushing rock, Richter has to find his way back into the light.  The only problem is that this monster of a man is being pursued by monsters, a demon, and his own foolish choices. Faced with all the dangers of the deep dark, what will Richter say when the buried horrors of The Land come a calling and asked if he's paid his dues?  Well he'll look right back, stare that horror in the eye, and say, \"Yes sir, the check is in the mail!\"  Welcome back my friends! Welcome back...to The Land!  PS - Gnomes still rule!

The Land: Founding, Book 1 of the Chaos Seeds Saga, reached number one in the Audible store in 2017!  A mesmerizing tale reminiscent of the wonder of Ready Player One and the adventure of Game of Thrones Number one in epic fantasy, cyberpunk, and video game fantasy  In The Land: Predators, the Mist Village has harnessed its power. With core buildings, Professional fighters, and now their own Dungeon, the settlement is primed to grow into a kingdom of true power and magic. The path to power has not been without risk, however. The Mist Village has been noticed. Evil nobles from the Kingdom of Law, bloodthirsty goblins from the Serrated Mountains, an undead lord with a penchant for human sacrifice, and fanatical kobolds from the Depths all plot the village's destruction. The predators are circling. Richter's people are horribly outnumbered by foes whose own power has been entrenched for thousands of years. Richter and Sion need to be stronger than ever before. Luckily, they are. New skills have been learned, stronger enchantments have been wrought, and the hundreds of villagers have answered the call to adventure. The Companions do not stand alone. While many eyes have turned toward the mists, wanting to take the treasures within, the Mist Village stares back with a simple message. Come and get it!",

BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.<br /> <br /> 'Anything you do in the past changes the future. The tiniest little actions have huge consequences. You might tread on an ant now and it might entirely prevent someone from being born in the future.'<br /> <br /> Rincewind, inept wizard and reluctant hero, has found himself magically stranded on the Discworld's last continent.<br /> <br /> It's hot. It's dry. There was this thing once called The Wet, which no one believes in any more. Practically everything that's not poisonous is venomous. But it's the best bloody place in the world, all right?<br /> <br /> And in a few days, it will die. The only thing standing between the last continent and wind-blown doom is Rincewind, and he can't even spell wizard. Still . . . no worries, eh?<br /> <br /> <i>The Last Continent </i>is the sixth book in the Wizards series, but you can listen to the Discworld novels in any order.<br /> <br /> The first book in the Discworld series - <i>The Colour of Magic</i> - was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.<br /> <br /> <b>'A minor masterpiece. I laughed so much I fell from my armchair' </b><i>Time Out</i><br /> <br /> </p>",

But \"control\" is a slippery thing, and even as Grayland strives to save as many of her people form impoverished isolation, the forces opposing her rule will make a final, desperate push to topple her from her throne and power, by any means necessary. Grayland and her thinning list of allies must use every tool at their disposal to save themselves, and all of humanity. And yet it may not be enough.</p> <p>Will Grayland become the savior of her civilization...or the last emperox to wear the crown?</p>",

    "description": "I no longer exist. My kidnapping, breaking and corruption at the hands of the half-human, half-demon Nephilim began the journey to nothingness. I had hoped to one day rejoin my loved ones in the outside world, but before I realized it, twenty years had passed. Time is a distance I cannot traverse. If there is any memory of me, it is distant. Worse, the spirit of Nephil, Lord of the Nephilim, used my connection with the continent to decimate the surface world. I've done horrible things in the past, but I'm now responsible for the deaths of billions. Billions. God...  And so I have removed myself from the physical world, and Nephil's reach, to live out eternity in Tartarus, a place of endless torture where the burden I carry crushes my soul, driving me to madness. I am weak and cold. My abilities are gone. And I am not alone in this hell. There are things here more horrible than I could have imagined.  But as much as I think I deserve this fate, I'm driven to find a way to escape. To exist again. To return to my new family-Em and Luca. To set things right. I am Solomon Ull Vincent-The Last Hunter-and I will exist again.  *The Last Hunter: Ascent parallels the events in Antarktos Rising, an adult thriller also by Robinson, upon which the Antarktos Saga is based. Listen to them in order for the full experience. The final two books in the Antarktos Saga will complete both storylines as they merge.",

    "description": "\"I've been told that the entire continent of Antarctica groaned at the moment of my birth. The howl tore across glaciers, over mountains and deep into the ice. Everyone says so. Except for my father; all he heard was Mother's sobs. Not of pain, but of joy, so he says. Other than that, the only verifiable fact about the day I was born is that an iceberg the size of Los Angeles broke free from the ice shelf a few miles off the coast. Again, some would have me believe the fracture took place as I entered the world. But all that really matters, according to my parents, is that I, Solomon Ull Vincent, the first child born on Antarctica - the first and only Antarctican - was born on September 2nd, 1974.  \"If only someone could have warned me that, upon my return to the continent of my birth thirteen years later, I would be kidnapped, subjected to tortures beyond comprehension and forced to fight... and kill. If only someone had hinted that I'd wind up struggling to survive in a subterranean world full of ancient warriors, strange creatures and supernatural powers.  \"Had I been warned I might have lived a normal life. The human race might have remained safe. And the fate of the world might not rest on my shoulders. Had I been warned....  \"This is my story - the tale of Solomon Ull Vincent - The Last Hunter.\"",

    "description": "In all the days since my kidnapping, breaking and transformation into a hunter at the hands of the half-human, half-demon Nephilim, my life has been a mass of chaotic actions and reactions to the horrors of the Antarctic underworld. I have battled unnatural monsters, fled for my life, and sacrificed everything - or thought I had, when I stepped through the gates of Tartarus. Every choice I have made was in response to forces beyond my control, lacking any kind of direction.  But now, reunited with my friends, Kainda and Em, and in the company of new friends, Wright and Kat, I am taking control of the chaos and choosing my own direction-down. Deeper than the realm of Hades, the most feared of the Nephilim, deeper than the gates of Tartarus and deeper than any human being has ventured since the beginnings of the human race.  My goal is simple-find the Jericho shofar, a weapon revealed to me by Chronus the Titan. I don't know what it does or how it works, but I know the Nephilim fear it and that Nephil, possessing the body of Ninnis, will do anything to stop me from recovering it. The path will be dangerous and the cost might be great, but my path is clear: retrieve the shofar, return to the surface and prepare for war.  My name is Solomon Ull Vincent - the Last Hunter - and I am done running.  About the author: Jeremy Robinson is the author of numerous novels including Pulse, Instinct, and Threshold,the first three books in his exciting Jack Sigler series, which is also the focus of and expanding series of co-authored novellas deemed the Chesspocalypse.

    "description": "The past few years have been a mixture of torture, painful growth and sometimes, pushing its way through all the darkness - joy. I have made friends and allies, brothers and sisters, mentors and... Kainda, who is something else entirely. But someone is missing, someone whose memory saved me from despair - Mirabelle Whitney, my hope. So while the human race prepares to defend itself, I ride toward the encroaching Nephilim army intending to save Mira, return to our feeble base and lead the charge against those who plan to wipe the human race from the face of the Earth.  It sounds like an impossible plan, and maybe it is, but if we're going to die, we're going to die like hunters - boldly and bravely. More than that, we're going to die together, as a united race facing a common enemy. Nationality no longer matters. Ancient grudges are forgotten. The human race must resist as one, or face extinction. And now it falls to me, along with Kainda, Em, Mira, Kat, Merrill, Aimee and Luca, to light the path for humanity in our darkest hour. Harnessing the power of the ancient Jericho shofar, we must prevent Nephil, the most ancient and evil of the Nephilim from possessing my body and using its supernatural abilities against mankind.  The odds are stacked against victory. The Nephilim out-size, out-power and outnumber us ten to one, but we will fight to the last, the very last, so help me God.  I am Solomon Ull Vincent - the Last Hunter and King of Antarktos - and I am prepared to face my fate.",

They brought me to a world beneath the surface of Antarctica, where I was broken and trained by a hunter named Ninnis. He served the ancient Nephilim: half-human, half-demon monsters. My personality was buried in my subconscious and replaced by that of Ull, a hunter and killer.  \"For a time, I too served the Nephilim. As the first and only human born on Antarctica, they believed that I could contain the spirit of their fallen king, Nephil, and lead them to conquer humanity.  \"But I was stronger than they knew and escaped deep into the underworld, where I have been hiding for the past two years. I live in a cavern, which is somehow lush with green vegetation, eking out a living and cowering from the confrontation that I know awaits me. But the nightmare has found me. I can smell them. The hunters. They have discovered my hideout.  \"The pursuit of Solomon Ull Vincent - the last hunter - has begun. And if they catch me, this is where my story will end.\"",

Change is coming to the world, from the King of Destruction moving to a certain doctor finding more friends from home. The Wandering Inn has a princess who solves problems rather than creates them, and her name is Lyonette. Yet what happens when the innkeeper returns to manage her inn? Lyonette must learn to be a good employee rather than manage everything herself, and sharing power is never easy... Nor is it ever simple in war, but that is where Geneva Scala remains. In bloodier and increasingly brutal battlefields, The Last Light of Baleros is now growing in fame, but there is no future there. She is desperate, working against hostile forces who see her intervention as dangerous, and still bears the wounds of her previous war to save lives. But she is no longer alone. ",

BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.<br /> <br /> 'Darkness isn't the opposite of light, it is simply its absence . . . what was radiating from the book was the light that lies on the far side of darkness, the light fantastic.'<br /> <br /> The Discworld is in danger, heading towards a seemingly inevitable collision with a malevolent red star, its magic fading. It needs a hero, and fast.<br /> <br /> What it doesn't need is Rincewind, an inept and cowardly wizard who is still recovering from the trauma of falling off the edge of the world. Or Twoflower, the well-meaning tourist whose luggage has a mind (and legs) of its own.<br /> <br /> Which is a shame, because that's all there is . . .<br /> <br /> <i>The Light Fantastic </i>is the second book in the Wizards series, but you can listen to the Discworld novels in any order.<br /> <br /> The first book in the Discworld series - <i>The Colour of Magic</i> - was published in 1983.

While the patched-up ship has seen better days, it offers her a bed, a chance to explore the far-off corners of the galaxy, and most importantly, some distance from her past. An introspective young woman who learned early to keep to herself, she’s never met anyone remotely like the ship’s diverse crew, including Sissix, the exotic reptilian pilot, chatty engineers Kizzy and Jenks, who keep the ship running, and Ashby, their noble captain. </p> <p>Life aboard the <i>Wayfarer</i> is chaotic and crazy - exactly what Rosemary wants. It’s also about to get extremely dangerous when the crew is offered the job of a lifetime. Tunneling wormholes through space to a distant planet is definitely lucrative and will keep them comfortable for years. But risking her life wasn’t part of the plan. In the far reaches of deep space, the tiny <i>Wayfarer</i> crew will confront a host of unexpected mishaps and thrilling adventures that force them to depend on each other. To survive, Rosemary’s got to learn how to rely on this assortment of oddballs - an experience that teaches her about love and trust and that having a family isn’t necessarily the worst thing in the universe.</p>",

I was thrilled to have him on the Mistborn series, and he did such an amazing job I can’t imagine having anyone else be the voice of these characters.\" —Brandon SandersonReturn to #1 New York Times bestseller Brandon Sanderson’s Mistborn world of Scadrial as its second era, which began with The Alloy of Law, comes to its earth-shattering conclusion in The Lost Metal. For years, frontier lawman turned big-city senator Waxillium Ladrian has hunted the shadowy organization the Set—with his late uncle and his sister among their leaders—since they started kidnapping people with the power of Allomancy in their bloodlines. When Detective Marasi Colms and her partner Wayne find stockpiled weapons bound for the Outer City of Bilming, this opens a new lead. Conflict between Elendel and the Outer Cities only favors the Set, and their tendrils now reach to the Elendel Senate—whose corruption Wax and Steris have sought to expose—and Bilming is even more entangled.After Wax discovers a new type of explosive that can unleash unprecedented destruction and realizes that the Set must already have it, an immortal kandra serving Scadrial’s god, Harmony, reveals that Bilming has fallen under the influence of another god: Trell, worshipped by the Set. And Trell isn’t the only factor at play from the larger Cosmere—Marasi is recruited by offworlders with strange abilities who claim their goal is to protect Scadrial...at any cost.Wax must choose whether to set aside his rocky relationship with God and once again become the Sword that Harmony has groomed him to be. If no one steps forward to be the hero Scadrial needs, the planet and its millions of people will come to a sudden and calamitous ruin.Other Tor titles by Brandon Sanderson The Cosmere  The Stormlight Archive The Way of Kings Words of Radiance Edgedancer (Novella) OathbringerDawnshard (Novella)Rhythm of War The Mistborn trilogy Mistborn: The Final Empire The Well of Ascension The Hero of Ages Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series Alloy of Law Shadows of Self Bands of MourningThe Lost Metal Collection Arcanum Unbounded Other Cosmere novels Elantris Warbreaker The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians The Scrivener's Bones The Knights of Crystallia The Shattered Lens The Dark Talent The Rithmatist series The Rithmatist Other titles by Brandon Sanderson The Reckoners Steelheart Firefight CalamityA Macmillan Audio production from Tor Books.",

It feels so real it could almost be nonfiction, and yet it has the narrative drive and power of a rocket launch. This is Apollo 13 times ten.\" -Douglas Preston, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Impact and Blasphemy  \"A book I just couldn't put down! It has the very rare combination of a good, original story, interestingly real characters and fascinating technical accuracy…reads like MacGyver meets Mysterious Island.\" -Astronaut Chris Hadfield, Commander of the International Space Station and author of An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth  \"The best book I've read in ages. Clear your schedule before you crack the seal. This story will take your breath away faster than a hull breech. Smart, funny, and whiteknuckle intense, The Martian is everything you want from a novel.\" -Hugh Howey, New York Times bestselling author of Wool  \"The Martian kicked my ass! Weir has crafted a relentlessly entertaining and inventive survival thriller, a MacGyver trappedon Mars tale that feels just as real and harrowing as the true story of Apollo 13.\" -Ernest Cline, New York Times bestselling author of Ready Player One  \"Gripping…shapes up like Defoe's Robinson Crusoe as written by someone brighter.\" -Larry Niven, multiple Hugo and Nebula Award-winning author of the Ringworld series and Lucifer's Hammer  \"The tension simply never lets up, from the first page to the last, and at no point does the believability falter for even a second. You can't shake the feeling that this could all really happen.\" -Patrick Lee, New York Times bestselling author of The Breach and Ghost Country  Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars.  Now, he's sure he'll be the first person to die there.  After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he's alive - and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive.  Chances are, though, he won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plainold \"human error\" are much more likely to kill him first.  But Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills - and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit - he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?\"",

    "description": "When two galactic forces collide—one spreading chaos, the other demanding order—New York Times and number one Audible best-selling author Jeremy Robinson defends Earth with characters from three of his fan-favorite novels: The Others, Flux, and Exo-Hunter. Mysterious gateways are appearing throughout the universe, bridging violent civilizations, leading to war, and sowing chaos. While some species succumb to the pandemonium, the Chut’un forge an unholy symbiotic relationship—The Order—with red Europhids, a vast hive intelligence populating the universe’s far reaches. Desiring structure and fearing the unknown, they cull everything opposed to their plan, including the Europhids’ blue counterparts, carrying out a galactic genocide until only one blue Europhid remains...inside Moses Montgomery, a.k.a. \"Dark Horse\". As a Rapid Reaction Force Marine from 1989, Dark Horse and his team were sent 1,000 years into the future where they defeated the Union, an evil fascist empire. Back in the present, after preventing the Union from ever forming, Dark Horse and his team of...unique operators from the past and the future are ready to kick back, listen to some tunes, and enjoy the timeline they saved. But as the last threat to The Order’s machinations, Dark Horse finds himself with an alien target on his back. Joined by Dan Delgado and Wini Finch (The Others) and Owen McCoy (Flux), the team attempts to understand the gates that first appeared in New Hampshire and now in Antarctica. Despite their vast experience with the strange and otherworldly, none of them are prepared for what comes next. Three members of the team are abducted, whisked away to another planet. Alive or dead, no one knows. Dark Horse and his now ragtag team struggle to track down their missing teammates while being hunted themselves. With the fate of his friends—and all of Earth—hanging in the balance, Dark Horse is forced to take insane risks, create chaos, and do anything to get his people back. To save humanity...he must sacrifice his own. PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.",

    "description": "<p>Milton, Brint, Whisp, and the Guardian Guild are back in the conclusion to the Station Cores series!</p> <p>After the events that previously occurred near the northeastern border of the Kingdom, Milton has a lot of work to do. Not only does the Station Core have to hide his dungeon from the rampaging hordes originating from the Quizard Mountains, but he has to find somewhere to put thousands of children who are heading towards his dungeon for safety.</p> <p>If that wasn’t bad enough, Milton also has to find a place for millions of other citizens to live; even though they don’t even know who or what the Station Core is, they are counting on him to keep them safe. With that safety, though, comes a chance at something that they never thought they’d have: power...and revenge.</p> <p>Milton isn’t just going to build more habitations for them to stay comfortably in his new Underground Kingdom; no, he has a proposition for them that they would be fools to ignore. The acquisition of new abilities means that the need for an immediate education on how to control those new powers is paramount. Strangely enough, it’s time for some new students to enroll in Milton’s new Guardian University.</p> <p>But will they be able to learn well and fast enough to get the revenge they seek? In the end, they’ll have to - especially if they want to take on and defeat the army fielded by...the other Core.</p> <p>Contains litRPG and gamelit elements such as level progression and experience, optional tables, no harems, and a heavy dungeon core emphasis.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio. </b></p>",

    "description": "   Number one Audible.com Best Seller Winner: Independent Audiobook Award for Best Science Fiction - 2019 Winner: Voice Arts Award for Best Science Fiction - 2019  To save a missing girl... Dan Delgado is a private investigator. When it comes to finding cheating spouses, corporate thieves, or runaway teenagers, he’s unenthusiastic, and unmatched. As a former San Francisco detective, he misses more meaningful work, but he hasn’t had the heart for it since his wife’s death five years prior. That is, until a phone call from a distraught mother, an illegal immigrant who can’t go to the police, puts him on the hunt for a missing little girl. By the time he reaches the mother’s small home, she’s missing, too. The circumstances are strange, but when a team of heavily armed mercenaries arrive, Delgado is convinced there is more going on than a simple kidnapping. Joined by his wise-cracking elderly assistant, a gun-toting pastor, and a UFO enthusiast Uber driver, Delgado follows the clues west, to Colorado City, a town cleaved in two by the 37th parallel, also known as the UFO Highway. In a town infamous for fundamentalist Mormon cult activity, they uncover evidence of a massive child-trafficking ring whose ringleaders might not be human. Delgado and crew are plunged into a dangerous world of corporate competition, UFO lore, and government cover-ups. While they hunt for answers, they’re pursued across the Southwest by high-tech mercs, brainwashed cults, and beings whose true identity has been concealed since 1947. ...he must risk the world. UFOs and alien abductions remain some of the most hotly debated and mysterious subjects of the 21st century. In the decades since 1960, with reports of strange encounters on the rise, 13 million people have gone missing worldwide and never been found. The Others takes a fast-paced, unique, and moving look at the phenomenon that has fueled Jeremy Robinson’s imagination since several sightings, strange happenings, and visits with renowned UFO investigator and family friend Raymond Fowler.

    "description": "Five years after this sleeper hit took on the world of IT and flipped it on its head, the fifth anniversary edition of The Phoenix Project continues to guide IT in the DevOps revolution. In this newly updated and expanded edition of the best-selling The Phoenix Project, co-author Gene Kim includes a new afterword and a deeper delve into the Three Ways as described in The DevOps Handbook. Bill, an IT manager at Parts Unlimited, has been tasked with taking on a project critical to the future of the business, code named Phoenix Project. But the project is massively over budget and behind schedule. The CEO demands Bill must fix the mess in 90 days, or else Bill’s entire department will be outsourced. With the help of a prospective board member and his mysterious philosophy of the Three Ways, Bill starts to see that IT work has more in common with manufacturing plant work than he ever imagined. With the clock ticking, Bill must organize work flow, streamline interdepartmental communications, and effectively serve the other business functions at Parts Unlimited. In a fast-paced and entertaining style, three luminaries of the DevOps movement deliver a story that anyone who works in IT will recognize. Listeners will not only learn how to improve their own IT organizations, they’ll never view IT the same. PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.",

Then, it’s time to face the challenges the planet has to offer, and by using the many rewards from the treasure hunt, Jake aims to improve his repertoire while getting some more levels under his belt.<br /> <br /> And what could be a better idea than invading a massive termite hive to craft a new weapon using the extremely powerful curse of resentment from an ancient vampire land? Yeah, nothing could possibly go wrong with that.

Not the most auspicious start.</p> <p>But now, with the addition of Brint and his inventor friend, Whisp, Milton now has the tools available to turn his dungeon into one that should easily defend against all comers - or at least he hopes so.</p> <p>However, when the Cordpower Company - the makers of the original Power Potion - contract the best of the best to find out what happened to their agents, Milton’s dungeon is put to the test against two Proctans who are way out of his league.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Brint learns more about his ability to control the Combat Units that Milton creates, eventually being put into a position to lead an expedition into the Quizard Mountains. He hopes to find enough resources inside the caves to fully outfit the dungeon, making it even deadlier than it already is.</p> <p>Unfortunately, he finds something else....</p> <p>Contains litRPG/gamelit elements such as level progression and experience, optional tables, no harems, and a heavy dungeon core emphasis.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>",

    "description": "<p><b>From the author of the Gods Are Bastards series: The wickedly funny action-adventure portal fantasy continues—and things can only get worse . . .</b></p> <p>Not long ago, Seiji was an ill-tempered, misanthropic man at war with the world. But then he was transported to a strange, savage realm for the purpose of literally <i>making war on the world</i>. In this reality, he's an extremely reluctant evil overlord with a temperamental goddess patron to please.</p> <p>So in spite of his own natural unpleasantness, Seiji has tried to be the best bad guy he can be: providing for the downtrodden, offering healthcare to hookers, that sort of thing. Which has won him some staunch (but still diabolical) allies and a hell of a lot of enemies. Especially his main competitor in chaos and crime, Lady Gray, who really didn't appreciate being displaced by him.</p> <p>But Seiji's coming to realize that despite his brash, bold exterior, his very human psyche is taking a serious beating from the extreme brutality he's committed and witnessed. In fact, he's starting to wonder if being such a big bad dude is all it's cracked up to be—or if there's any way out of all this . . .</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit fantasy adventure series—with more than five million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>",

    "description": "<p>From best-selling author Neal Stephenson and critically acclaimed historical and contemporary commercial novelist Nicole Galland comes a captivating and complex near-future thriller combining history, science, magic, mystery, intrigue, and adventure that questions the very foundations of the modern world.&nbsp;</p><p>When Melisande Stokes, an expert in linguistics and languages, accidently meets military intelligence operator Tristan Lyons in a hallway at Harvard University, it is the beginning of a chain of events that will alter their lives and human history itself. The young man from a shadowy government entity approaches Mel, a low-level faculty member, with an incredible offer. The only condition: She must sign a nondisclosure agreement in return for the rather large sum of money.&nbsp;</p><p>Tristan needs Mel to translate some very old documents, which, if authentic, are earth-shattering. They prove that magic actually existed and was practiced for centuries. But the arrival of the scientific revolution and the Age of Enlightenment weakened its power and endangered its practitioners. Magic stopped working altogether in 1851, at the time of the Great Exhibition at London's Crystal Palace - the world's fair celebrating the rise of industrial technology and commerce. Something about the modern world \"jams\" the \"frequencies\" used by magic, and it's up to Tristan to find out why.&nbsp;</p><p>And so the Department of Diachronic Operations - D.O.D.O. - gets cracking on its real mission: to develop a device that can bring magic back and send Diachronic Operatives back in time to keep it alive...and meddle with a little history at the same time. But while Tristan and his expanding operation master the science and build the technology, they overlook the mercurial - and treacherous - nature of the human heart.&nbsp;</p><p>Written with the genius, complexity, and innovation that characterize all of Neal Stephenson's work and steeped with the down-to-earth warmth and humor of Nicole Galland's storytelling style, this exciting and vividly realized work of science fiction will make you believe in the impossible and take you to places - and times - beyond imagining.&nbsp;</p><p>Full cast of narrators includes Robert Fass, James Foster, Tavia Gilbert, Arthur Morey, David Stifel, Charlie Thurston, and Kate Udall.&nbsp;</p>",

But now <i>The Sagan Diary</i> shows us Sagan from another point of view - her own. As she prepares to leave military life and join her new husband and adopted daughter on a colony world, Sagan reflects on her life, in her own words - recalling friends, battles, and experiences; illustrating all the violence and wonder of her times; trying to fit \"an entire life into this compressed space\".</p> <p>For fans of Scalzi's works, it's an intimate and surprising glimpse into one of his most popular characters. As read by Stephanie Wolfe, it's unlike any other science-fiction story you'll hear this year.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The groundbreaking audio production of what <em>Los Angeles Times Magazine</em> called “the greatest epic in the history of comic books” continues. Leading perhaps the best cast ever assembled in audio, James McAvoy returns to voice Morpheus, the Lord of Dreams, in <em>The Sandman: Act III</em>, the third installment of the <em>New York Times</em> best-selling audio saga. Award-winning audio trailblazer Dirk Maggs adapts the blockbuster DC graphic novel series written by Neil Gaiman (<em>Good Omens</em>) into another fully immersive listening experience, presented for the first time in breathtaking 3D audio.</p><p>In <em>Act III</em>, we follow Morpheus on a grand journey to take care of family business. He visits with his son Orpheus (<em>Bridgerton</em>’s Regé-Jean Page), an act that brings with it profound consequences. Accompanied by Delirium (Kristen Schaal, <em>Bob’s Burgers</em>), he tracks down their estranged brother, Destruction (David Harewood, <em>Supergirl</em>), the only member of the Endless ever to abandon their post. And at an inn at the intersection of all worlds, a group of travelers are forced together by a storm that threatens to destroy reality itself, with grave repercussions for Morpheus and the rest of the Endless.</p><p>All the original cast returns, including Kat Dennings as Death, Aidan Turner as Cluracan, and Neil Gaiman himself as The Narrator, joined by Harewood and other new cast members Wil Wheaton (<em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>), KJ Apa (<em>Riverdale</em>), Shruti Haasan (<em>Race Gurram</em>), and more.</p><p>It’s time to close your eyes and listen. Once again.</p><p><strong><em>Please note:</em></strong><em> This content is not for kids. It is for mature audiences only.

Marooned on a desolate island, the survivors, now bitter enemies, are forced into an uneasy truce to withstand the merciless cold.</p> <p>Enter Jane Harper: undercover agent, razor-sharp and unflinching, wielding her wit as deftly as her fists. As she rallies the fractured group, they stumble upon ancient Viking ruins and awaken something primal and terrifying.</p> <p>Deep beneath the frozen ground, the <i>Draugar</i> stir. Undying Vikings walk the Earth again, controlled by hive-mind parasites connected by three sinister queens. Capable of subjugating and preserving all mammalian life, they see the world through ambitious eyes, spreading to any creature they can find—bears, whales, and even people.</p> <p>With time slipping away and the body count climbing, Jane must unravel the mystery of these parasites—whose origins may lie beyond the stars—and confront an unimaginable horror that transcends death itself. She fights not just for survival, but to prevent an unspeakable menace from consuming the world.</p> <p>With <i>The Sentinel</i>, #1 Audible and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Jeremy Robinson unlocks his demented mind, claws into the dark recesses of his imagination, and plucks out a tale of horror, humor, science fiction, and heart, that will keep you listening even as the dead pile up.</p>",

But that alone will not be enough, and he carefully explores the power of the mysterious Architect Role passed to him by the Goddess Uru.</p> <p>The solitude also provides Ruwen time to perfect his Bamboo Viper Steps and investigate the hidden layers the forms contain. Pushing himself physically, mentally, and spiritually momentarily lets him forget his grim existence.</p> <p>But as the seclusion persists, Overlord, the mental construct given life by the trap Rami triggered at Malth’s Library, continues to evolve, altering Ruwen’s mind, and causing Ruwen to doubt his sanity.</p> <p>Underlying the isolation, loneliness, and harsh conditions lives the fear that one mistake will result in permanent death.</p> <p>But if Ruwen doesn’t overcome that fear, and push himself to his limits, he will never leave this place. And the consequences to himself, his friends, and the Universe will be nothing short of catastrophic.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Milton Frederick was arguably the best player of Crowned Lieges of Destiny in the entire world. As the strategy coordinator for one of the top guilds, he was beginning to actually make a living from it. That was, until he was abducted by aliens.</p> <p>Instead of your stereotypical grey aliens with big black eyes who like to perform anal probes upon unsuspecting victims for unknown reasons, the Collective had a more altruistic purpose. Sure, kidnapping 100 humans from Earth, ripping them away from their lives and families, and erasing their memories doesn’t sound great - but the way they saw it, the benefits would far outweigh these side-effects. Seriously, who wouldn’t want their consciousness trapped in a Station Core, subjected to the whims of a collection of alien races, and then ordered to defend against other hostile aliens for all eternity? They’d be immortal - so...bonus!</p> <p>Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it), the Station Core now known as Milton never arrived at his destination. Severely damaged and confused about what happened to him, he woke up to find himself trapped inside a massive chicken egg on a strange, primitive world filled with curious - and deadly - creatures.</p> <p>Now, in order to survive the harsh environment, Milton has to rely on a snarky, foul-mouthed AI guide to show him what it means to be a Station Core. With her help, he might just live long enough to figure out a way to get off the planet - if only he wasn’t so afraid of squirrels....</p> <p>Contains litRPG/gamelit elements such as level progression and experience, optional tables, no harems, and a heavy dungeon-core emphasis.</p> <p>Based on feedback, there has been an update to include the absent footnotes to the narration. Many of the longer stat table footnotes are contained in separate chapters for ease of listening.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>",

    "description": "Adventuring doesn't ever really end, does it? Classes evolve, roles shift, and in the city of Liscor, change is happening. The Horns of Hammerad are growing as adventurers, rising in the eyes of the city and the surrounding lands. They've survived, and they've leveled, but new levels also bring new problems. Izril is still facing turmoil as nobles fight and squabble while Liscor breathes again and heals, trying to find a new way forward. The best cure for dark days? Games! And none know it better than the oldest adventurers, who've lived through countless struggles. Niers Astoragon is the greatest [Strategist] of Baleros, a leader in one of the Four Great Companies, and his students vie for his approval. They'll compete to become the best new generation of talented leaders and commanders. Glory, mischief, and competition await! What they've forgotten is that there are never low stakes with Niers. Compete for fame, compete for fun, but remember, there's no such thing as a bloodless game when you play against the Titan of Baleros.",

She’d be more excited about all of this if everything wasn’t trying to kill her. But an inn is what she’s found, and so that’s what she becomes; an innkeeper, who serves drinks to heroes and monsters. Actually, mostly monsters. But it’s a living, right? ",

As citizens flee from the drowning city, a sadistic Imperial interrogator seeks a lowly data-drone with a terrible secret. But when disaster strikes, the pair must rely on each other for survival as the Watcher in the Rain awaits them. Listen to it because: Hear a world in peril, with a magnificent soundscape acting as the backdrop to a thoroughly frightening tale of two enemies forced to work together against a darkness that will consume them both.

As their towering grey spires are punished by endless rain, countless administrators, tithe-masters, and book-keepers are forced to evacuate. Among them is Greta, a lowly data-drone with a terrible secret, wanted for questioning by the sadistic Imperial interrogator Stefan Crucius. As disaster strikes and the pair are left stranded in the depths of the drowning city, captor and captive must cooperate to stand any chance of escaping. But a mysterious presence stalks them through the abandoned, flooded towers, a dread entity each must confront but which neither dare acknowledge, a Watcher in the Rain. Written by Alec Worley. Running time 74 minutes. Performed by Matthew Hunt, Deeivya Meir, Melvin Rawlinson and Richard Reed.",

    "description": "<p>From number one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Brandon Sanderson, <i>The Way of Kings</i>, book one of the Stormlight Archive, begins an incredible new saga of epic proportion.</p> <p>Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.</p> <p>It has been centuries since the fall of the 10 consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them and won by them.</p> <p>One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where 10 armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.</p> <p>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.</p> <p>Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.</p> <p>The result of more than 10 years of planning, writing, and world-building, <i>The Way of Kings</i> is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.</p> <p>Speak again the ancient oaths:</p> <p>Life before death.</p> <p>Strength before weakness.</p> <p>Journey before destination.</p> <p>And return to men the Shards they once bore.</p> <p>The Knights Radiant must stand again.</p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:</p> <p>The Cosmere</p> <p>The Stormlight Archive:</p> <ul> <li><i>The Way of Kings</i></li> <li><i>Words of Radiance</i></li> <li><i>Edgedancer (Novella)</i></li> <li><i>Oathbringer</i></li> </ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:</p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire</i></li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension</i></li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages</i></li> </ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:</p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law</i></li> <li><i>Shadows of Self</i></li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning</i></li> </ul> <p>Collection:</p> <ul> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded</i></li> </ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels:</p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris</i></li> <li><i>Warbreaker</i></li> </ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:</p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians</i></li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones</i></li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia</i></li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens</i></li> <li><i>The Dark Talent</i></li> </ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:</p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist</i></li> </ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson:</p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners</i></li> <li><i>Steelheart</i></li> <li><i>Firefight</i></li> <li><i>Calamity</i></li> </ul>",

Forced into Fairyland to seek her kidnapped brother, Tiffany allies herself with the Chalk's local Nac Mac Feegle, aka the Wee Free Men, a clan of sheep-stealing, sword-wielding, six-inch-high blue men who are as fierce as they are funny. Together, they battle through an eerie and ever-shifting landscape, fighting brutal flying fairies, dream-spinning dromes, and grimhounds (black dogs with eyes of fire and teeth of razors) before ultimately confronting the Queen of the Elves, absolute ruler of a world in which reality intertwines with nightmare. And in the final showdown, Tiffany must face her cruel power alone. <p>In a riveting narrative equal parts suspense and humor, Carnegie Medalist Terry Pratchett returns to his internationally popular Discworld with a breath-taking tale certain to leave fans, new and old, enthralled.</p>",

    "description": "Evil has been defeated. The war has just begun.They did the impossible, deposing the godlike being whose brutal rule had lasted a thousand years. Now Vin, the street urchin who has grown into the most powerful Mistborn in the land, and Elend Venture, the idealistic young nobleman who loves her, must build a healthy new society in the ashes of an empire.They have barely begun when three separate armies attack. As the siege tightens, an ancient legend seems to offer a glimmer of hope. But even if it really exists, no one knows where to find the Well of Ascension or what manner of power it bestows.It may just be that killing the Lord Ruler was the easy part. Surviving the aftermath of his fall is going to be the real challenge.

BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.<br /> <br /> 'The universe is, instant by instant, recreated anew... The perfect moment is now. Be glad of it.'<br /> <br /> Time is a resource. Everyone knows it must be managed. You can let it move fast or slowly, but what you mustn't do is allow it to stop.<br /> <br /> On the Discworld, the History Monks have the important job of ensuring that tomorrow always comes. But the construction of the world's first truly accurate clock starts a race against, well... time.<br /> <br /> Monk Lu-Tze, his apprentice Lobsang Ludd and Death's granddaughter Susan must stop the clockmaker before he completes his task. Because a truly accurate clock will stop time completely.<br /> <br /> And then, there really will be no tomorrow...<br /> <br /> The Discworld novels can be listened to in any order, but <i>Thief of Time</i> is the fifth book in the Death series.<br /> <br /> The first book in the Discworld series - <i>The Colour of Magic - </i>was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.<br /> <br /> </p>",

Down into the Dead Fields. </p> <p>But the Dead Fields are not so dead as they seem. Things lurk in the mist, things far beyond the levels of Eve, Wes, Preston, and, especially, the hatchling Reginald. But Eve doesn't care. Sure, every darting shadow and every roar in the distance sends a chill up her spine, but just as any passing beast could prove the one threat she can't overcome, so, too, could it prove a windfall of valuable exp. Eve likes exp. </p> <p>Before the party can make their way past the deadly trellac, before they can return to civilization, before they can make their mark on this world with the power of friendship, overwhelming violence, and mediocre puns, they'll need to pick up a few levels. </p> <p>Eve and the gang are trapped in the Dead Fields, and they're going to have to grind their way out.</p>",

Each team has one objective: to capture and hold the castle at the very center of the battlefield. Strategy, alliances, pitched battles, and, of course, betrayal ... It all makes for great fun and even greater television.</p> <p>After all, none of these powerful aliens <i>really</i> die when they’re playing war.</p> <p>Except this time.

For the first time ever, the crawlers are fighting back. They are now one of the nine teams. And this season, there’s a tenth army on the playing field. The NPCs, who are normally used as nothing but cannon fodder, have become fully self-aware and formed a team of their own.</p> <p>For Donut and Katia, the stakes are even higher. Only one of them will be allowed to leave this level.</p> <p>If they all want to survive, they’re going to need a little help from a veteran or two.</p> <p>This is it.</p> <p>This is what they’ve been fighting toward.</p> <p><b>This is war.</b></p> <p><i>This inevitable ruin.</i></p>",

Though nobody's quite sure why they fought or who actually won, each species still bears the cultural scars and views the other with simmering animosity. Lately, an influential dwarf, Grag Hamcrusher, has been fomenting unrest among Ankh-Morpork's more diminutive citizens. And it doesn't help matters when the pint-size provocateur is discovered beaten to death, with a troll club lying nearby.</p> <p>Vimes knows the well-being of his city depends on his ability to solve the Hamcrusher homicide. But there's more than one corpse waiting for him in the vast mine network the dwarfs have been excavating beneath Ankh-Morpork's streets. A deadly puzzle is pulling Sam Vimes deep into the muck and mire of superstition, hatred, and fear, and perhaps all the way to Koom Valley itself.</p>",

But as humanity builds its interstellar empire in the alien ruins, the mysteries and threats grow deeper. </p> <p>In the dead systems where gates lead to stranger things than alien planets, Elvi Okoye begins a desperate search to discover the nature of a genocide that happened before the first human beings existed and to find weapons to fight a war against forces at the edge of the imaginable. But the price of that knowledge may be higher than she can pay. </p> <p>At the heart of the empire, Teresa Duarte prepares to take on the burden of her father's godlike ambition. The sociopathic scientist Paolo Cortázar and the Mephistophelian prisoner James Holden are only two of the dangers in a palace thick with intrigue, but Teresa has a mind of her own and secrets even her father, the emperor, doesn't guess. </p> <p>And throughout the wide human empire, the scattered crew of the Rocinante fights a brave rear-guard action against Duarte's authoritarian regime. </p> <p>Memory of the old order falls away, and a future under Laconia's eternal rule - and with it, a battle that humanity can only lose - seems more and more certain. Because against the terrors that lie between worlds, courage and ambition will not be enough....</p>",

    "description": "<p>Harper Lee’s Pulitzer prize-winning masterwork of honor and injustice in the deep south - and the heroism of one man in the face of blind and violent hatred, available now for the first time as a digital audiobook. </p> <p>One of the best-loved stories of all time, <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> has been translated into more than 40 languages, sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, served as the basis for an enormously popular motion picture, and was voted one of the best novels of the 20th century by librarians across the country. A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father - a crusading local lawyer - risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.</p>",

    "description": "<p>If given the chance to be a genius, few people would say no. Outstanding talent is a key component of great success, after all. What form this ‘great success’ takes is largely up to the individual, but it is often associated with money, fame, and power. Selfish pursuits, yes, but it is only natural to look out for number one first and foremost. This is true even of the altruistic. For instance, if some wonder-child figures out a foolproof way to achieve lasting world peace they would still need an immense amount of influence and resources to turn that idea into reality. And then, the more they struggle to achieve their vision, the more the harshness of the world frays away at their moral fiber until they become jaded, disillusioned, and unwilling to sacrifice their own gains for the benefit of the unwashed masses. It is a tale as old as time.</p> <p>A tale that Boxxy never cared for. The prodigal shapeshifter skipped all that sappy stuff and jumped straight to the ‘selfish asshole’ part, as befitting a true-blooded monster. The only good that thing’s ever done was either coincidental or with ulterior motives in mind. Dismantling conspiracies, taking down crime lords, culling dangerous beasts–every move it makes is done with the purpose of increasing its bottom line or extending its life expectancy, usually both. Its latest scheme is no different. It just has to dump those troublesome triplets on someone else and find a cure for its demonic affliction that doesn’t involve the one-time divine favor it fought so hard to get. The first half is more or less settled and just needs time. That second bit will prove far more challenging. Though the monster is a genius in various fields, tainted souls don’t fall within its area of expertise. On the upside, some other prodigy with the appropriate talents will have surely figured this out already. All the shapeshifter had to do is find them, capture them, and then torture the information out of them.</p>",

    "description": "Small town reporter Mia Durante finds herself having brunch with the President of the United States on the day civilization comes to an end. An electromagnetic pulse blinds the U.S. Cars crash. Planes fall. Chaos reigns. Power is restored within minutes, but it’s already too late. Russian nukes are falling. U.S. allies around the world are already wiped out. The United States will cease to exist inside of five minutes. After giving the order to launch a full-scale retaliation–dooming the planet–the president, his staff, Secret Service and those lucky enough to be visiting the White House, are whisked below ground, where they board several Earth Escape Pods. As the EEPs launch into Earth orbit, missiles descend. Less than forty survive the end of the world. When they return, they’re greeted by survivors of a different sort. The bloodbath that follows leaves Durante and nine other survivors on the run. They find themselves fighting for survival in a world in which only torment remains and where death is the only escape. Torment is award-winning author Jeremy Robinson’s first pulse-pounding horror novel (originally penned under his Jeremy Bishop pseudonym). It's a horrific tale of post-apocalyptic terror that is one part zombie story and one part Dante’s Inferno. The story asks hard questions and generates strong emotions in everyone who listens to it—anger, excitement, and most of all: fear. This book asks the question that everyone is afraid to answer: are you ready?",

Yet he can’t remain in hiding anymore: He has to bind his apprentice, Granuaile, to the earth so that she can become the first new Druid in centuries.<br /> <br /> But the Roman god Bacchus wants mortal revenge for a slight against him, and he proceeds to act on the principle that Atticus should hate his life until it can be ended. Members of the Norse pantheon aren’t particularly pleased with Atticus either—especially one who had languished in darkness, slowly going mad, and is now free to work his mischief again.<br /> <br /> On top of that, an ancient vampire, who’d like to remove Atticus and Granuaile as threats to his kind, is working on his own plan for their destruction.<br /> <br /> Forced to work at the base of Mount Olympus, Atticus and Granuaile must survive the three-month process of her binding and escape the many traps set for them.

For Sarah, a 20-year-old college dropout, it’s an early morning serving donuts and coffee to commuters at North Station. Fate brings them together at the scene of a bank robbery, which they foil together, along with a mysterious and wealthy woman named Helen, who offers to reward them for their bravery. But before they can reach Helen’s penthouse, they are assaulted by men and women from all walks of life, including police officers. Helen displays impressive fighting skills, fending off the attacks, allowing Henry and Sarah to make their escape - but they are spotted and pursued by the violent cult, out for Helen’s blood...and now theirs.  Racing through the streets of Boston, Sarah and Henry are propelled into a strange and ancient underworld where the impossible is real, where the old world still lives, and where the gods still walk among us. As the pair wages war against the killers hunting them, they discover the truth about who their deceased parents were, and that their lives could be far more exceptional than either believed possible...if they can survive the day. With Tribe, number-one Audible and New York Times best-selling author Jeremy Robinson brings mythology to the modern world, combining his trademarked fast-paced action and well developed characters and taking them to new levels of craziness. It’s 300, John Wick, and Wonder Woman rolled into a new kind of literary insanity.",

With members of the Norse pantheon out for his blood, he can’t train his apprentice in peace, so he asks Coyote to help him fake his own death. The cost, however, might wind up being every bit as high as if he’d made no deal at all.<br /> <br /> There are things hiding in the Arizona desert that don’t want any company, and Coyote makes sure they know Atticus has arrived. And then there's the hound of Hel, Garm, who’s terribly difficult to shake and not at all convinced that Atticus is dead.<br /> <br /> Being tricked by a trickster is par for the course. But it’s the betrayal from someone he thought was a friend that shakes Atticus to the core and places his life in jeopardy.

    "description": "<p>Finally settled into Accord, Sean’s work had barely begun. The plan was to take away Lord Truestrike’s powerbase, then move against him, with Hallie working to strengthen their ties with the nobility. Sean knew better than to get involved with that side of things, knowing he’d just say the wrong things to the wrong people.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;While Hallie worked on alliances, Sean focused on healing, bringing the conflict with Truestrike to the fore— the Lord tried to use his influence to push Sean out of the healing guild. The attempt failed spectacularly, as not only was Sean not thrown out, he ended with the majority of the guild siding with him.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Having the healers behind him helped Sean do more. Truestrike’s plots to injure the city guard kept being thwarted, and with the healers on his side, Sean was able to save the majors being targeted. His actions in stopping every attempt to destabilize the guards earned him goodwill with Commander Queensblood.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Beyond helping the guard, Sean also enforced a broken Agreement, bringing him before Advisor Mackenzie Earthfoot. He was meant to explain why he’d cost a noble his hand, but Sean did what he always did: he proved his innocence by helping someone. Giving Mackenzie her foot back put her into debt to him, giving him powerful allies just as the gala began.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The gala was a night of politics. Sean healed those his friends brought him to and tried to not react when he finally met Truestrike. The conflict that happened wasn’t with Lord Truestrike, but his daughter, Trisha. After asking Sean for a dance, the Dame accused Sean of killing Darragh back in Oakwood, then shoved him and stormed off the dance floor.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;With the gala over, Sean wondered what was going to happen next. He’d made more allies, been recognized before all of society by the Advisor, and his clash with Truestrike was known. The only thing he was sure of was that the Queens would learn about him, and now, his time was running out before they came to Accord.</p>",

Spicy and heartfelt—this one is a winner all around.”—Katee Robert, author of </b><b><i>Neon Gods</i></b></p> <p>As the daughter of an ambitious merchant, Guinevere’s path has been predetermined: marry into a noble house of the Dwendalian Empire, raise her family’s station, and live quietly as a lordling’s obedient wife. But Guinevere longs for a life unbounded by expectations, for freedom and passion and adventure.</p> <p>Those distant dreams become a sudden reality when her caravan is beset by bandits, leaving her guards slain and Guinevere stranded alone on the dangerous Amber Road. Her only chance of survival is to travel alongside Oskar, the aloof half-orc who saved her during the attack.</p> <p>Unlike Guinevere, Oskar’s path is not so set in stone. With his mother dead and his apprenticeship abandoned, all that’s left is a long, lonely walk to a land he’s never seen to find family he’s never met. The last thing he needs is a spoiled waif like Guinevere slowing him down—even if the spark between them sizzles with promise.</p> <p>Despite his cold exterior, Oskar is brave and thoughtful and unlike anyone Guinevere has ever met. And while Guinevere may be sheltered, she brings out a softness in him that he has never dared to feel before. As the flames of their passion grow, they realize that soon they’ll need to choose between their expected destinations or their blossoming romance.</p> <p>Written by <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Thea Guanzon at the behest of Critical Role’s Jester Lavorre, <i>Tusk Love</i> brings the most romantic story on Exandrian bookshelves to life.</p>",

He must leave his apprentice behind, along with his Irish wolfhound, Oberon - and he must also leave his sword. The Morrigan has always taken extreme pleasure in pronouncing the Druid’s mortal danger and imminent doom, so the fact that she won’t reveal the purpose of their journey makes him very nervous. Of course, any time the Celtic Chooser of the Slain drops in unannounced, it’s never good. When she does let slip that she’ll be saving his life in the near future, Atticus is left to wonder...will he soon be giving his legions of enemies something to crow about? </p> <p><b>Includes a preview of Kevin Hearne’s highly anticipated new novel in The Iron Druid Chronicles, <i>Trapped!</i></b></p>",

She was right—for a while.</p> <p>However, Earth's recent success against the ravenous gnosiphages has drawn the eyes of other extraterrestrial life. Humanity's unprecedented growth across fields of technology and magic thanks to the Archive has the greater powers across the galaxy worried. They've sent three powerful warriors to observe Earth's hosts and—if necessary—put them down for good.</p> <p>Worse, the brief period of global unification mankind experienced during the invasion is already starting to strain. A shadowy group of Archive-enhanced terrorists has begun to emerge, and if they're not found and stopped, it could mean global war.</p> <p>With enemies closing in at home and from beyond, Anya and her friends will have to watch their backs or lose everything they've fought so hard to gain.</p> <p><i>This book contains strong language and graphic violence.</i></p>",

Further, the Patriarch is learning there might be someone worth sticking around for in his future. If she would just stop being so hard-headed. </p> <p>David believes he is smarter than the rest. Now, he must fight both the Patriarch and the Queen Bitch. Are his days numbered? </p> <p>Performed by Colleen Delany, Emily Beresford, James Konicek, Terence Aselford, Michael John Casey, Steve Wannall, Bianca Bryan, Christopher Graybill, Rob McFadyen, Eva Wilhelm, Eric Messner, Bradley Foster Smith, Matthew Schleigh, Matthew Pauli, James Lewis, Nora Achrati, Matthew Bassett, Danny Gavigan, Joel David Santner, Anthony Palmini, Alejandro Ruiz, Jacob Yeh, Yasmin Tuazon, Holly Adams, Ken Jackson, Robb Moreira, Zeke Alton, Jonathan Lee Taylor, Darius Johnson, Henry W.

To his delight, he’s greeted by Masters of his craft, a Grandmaster on the brink of ascension, and a method to fix his most glaring flaws.<br /> <br /> Barely entering the tower before being sent away once more, Joe is given a quest by the soon-to-be Sage: leave Vanaheim for another world, learn to fight as a combat ritualist, improve his foundational skills, and return with a Mythic core no matter how long it takes.<br /> <br /> There's plenty for him to accomplish on Midgard. His guild, town, and Pathfinders Hall need an upgrade. Not to mention, there aren’t many places in Eternium he can go to win a fight using only Novice rituals.

The Ritualist’s return triggers a retaliation years in the making, but they’ve made one major mistake....<br /> <br /> <b>He's already RSVPed, and Joe's not going to miss his mom’s big day—even if he needs to tap out and let the world burn.</b></p>",

    "description": "<p><b>Magic weapons. Deadly monsters. Epic quests. All just another day in the life of a Vigil.</b></p> <p>Boyd Knight found his calling when he joined the Marines and qualified for the elite Force Recon. He’d found a tribe and a family, so when a hand grenade landed near his team, he jumped on it without thought or regret.</p> <p>But instead of winding up dead, he wakes up butt naked in a cave full of monsters with a knife in one hand and a pistol in the other. He’s been chosen by Raguel, Five-Faced God of Justice, and entrusted with the power of the Vigil Bound. Every kill makes him stronger, and thanks to the Ascendant System, Boyd can level up, unlock increasingly powerful spells, and even harness the abilities of the monsters he’s been dispatched to hunt.</p> <p>If he can survive the deadly shapeshifter stalking him from the shadows, Boyd’s second life promises to be even more ass-kickingly epic than his first.</p> <p>From the bestselling author of <i>Rogue Dungeon</i>, <i>Bibliomancer</i>, <i>Shadowcroft Acadmey for Dungeons</i> and <i>Viridian Gate Online</i> comes a shoot-'em-up LitRPG fantasy series brimming with spells, upgrades, guns, and monsters!</p>",

    "description": "After the passage of two decades, the Omnians discovered a second, critical clue about the Nua'll, humankind's enemy, while investigating Celus-4, the home world of the intelligent, canine-like aliens, the Dischnya.  This striking discovery, combined with the final broadcast of the Nua'll sphere at Libre, prior to its detonation, gave Alex Racine and company the means to narrow the search for the Nua'll home world.  Alex has a consuming desire to locate the point of origin of the Nua'll before another gigantic sphere arrives to destroy more colonies. The first sphere's incursion into the Confederation burned billions of humans to ash.  Six scout ships are constructed by the Omnians and crewed by SADEs, self-aware digital entities, to search the stars along a narrow path defined by the two clues.  During its search, a scout ship, the Vivian, is captured by an alien warship in a faraway system that the SADEs dub Vinium. The two ships, locked tightly together in a form of electronic warfare, achieve an impasse.  The scout ship calls for help, and Alex Racine receives the strange message. According to the SADEs, the aliens aboard the warship appear to be plant people.  Rescuing the scout ship presents Alex and his companions the opportunity to meet the plant people, the Vinians, on their home world. It leads the Omnians to one more incredible discovery about the Nua'll, which, unfortunately, proves Alex's worst fears. ",

At least it is for everyone stranded in Viridian Gate Online, the only RPG where you can swap the apocalypse for an avatar and a fist full of magic . . .</b></p> <p>Jack Mitchell knows he won't survive the impact of the massive asteroid hurtling towards Earth. He's not one of the handful of lucky lottery winners scheduled for rescue. But he did luck into a NexGenVR capsule, which means Jack can risk a one-way trip to the world of Viridan Gate Online (V.G.O.), an ultra-immersive fantasy role-playing game. Taking that leap of faith, though, means permanently trapping his mind in the game and killing his body in the process.</p> <p>Worse, one in six die during the transition, and even if Jack beats the odds, he'll still have to navigate a world filled with vicious monsters, domineering AIs, and cutthroat players. And when Jack stumbles upon a secret conspiracy to sell off virtual real estate to the ultrawealthy—transforming V.G.O. into a new feudal dark age—the deadly creatures inhabiting Viridian Gate's expansive dungeons will be the least of his concerns.</p> <p>If Jack can't game the system, he's going to be trading in a quick death for a long, brutal one.

Now Abby will have to go where no Traveler has ever been allowed before, face a series of grueling trials, and battle the gods themselves, risking everything to return balance and save her sorceric brethren.</p> <p>If she fails, the realm of Gaia could once again be overrun by the power of the elements. If she succeeds, she'll become the greatest Firebrand in all of Eldgard.</p>",

In humanity’s final hours, a lucky few earn a one-way ticket to the brand-new, ultra-immersive, fantasy-based VRMMORPG, Viridian Gate Online. Making that leap of faith might mean survival, but it comes with a steep price tag: “Travelers” will forever be stranded as digital avatars inside a fantastical world filled with vicious monsters, all-powerful AIs, and cutthroat players. Let the games begin....</p> <p>Six amazing authors. Six incredible new tales. All set in the best-selling Viridian Gate Online Universe. Side Quests is an anthology for fans, by the fans!</p> <p>Included in <i>Side Quests:</i></p> <p>\"A Gentleman’s Work\"<i> </i>by James A. Hunter - When an Imperial Inquisitor captures a Thieves Guild Operative, Cutter must undertake a deadly rescue mission while using every grift in the book to stay one step ahead of a Headsman’s Blade. And the prize for this extraordinary quest? Nothing short of the keys to the Rowanheath Thieves Guild. Deception, subterfuge, and heavy drinking - all in a day’s work for a Gentleman...</p> <p>\"The Funeral Parlor\"<i> </i>by Raymond Johnson - A young spiderling is stranded in an alien land, surrounded by hostile creatures. Forced to fight for her life in a bid to find her way home, she must transform into the predator she is destined to become or die alone and forgotten, trapped in a dark world know as the Shadowverse.</p> <p>\"The Raiding of Rowanheath\" by J.D. Astra - The Crimson Alliance has breached the walls of Rowanheath, inciting Aleixo Carrera’s rage. Now Abby and her rag-tag invasion crew must reach the keep’s Command Center before the defending troops mobilize and shut down the takeover, else they’ll lose the battle and the war for Eldgard’s freedom.</p> <p>\"The Ballad of Jaro Edgewalker\" by N.H. Paxton - Jaro is an assassin, and he’s good at it. But when he finds a foe that is insurmountable by normal means and uncovers a plot to destroy everything he loves, Jaro has to balance his morality with his love for his friends and make an incredibly difficult decision.</p> <p>\"Buried Alive\" by Nicholas Reid - Carlos Vega thinks he’s escaping certain death by entering the virtual world of V.G.O., but instead he’s swallowed alive by the deadly Barren Sands. He’ll have to overcome the riddles and horrors of a long-forgotten temple in order to escape, but can he do it before the evil sealed there centuries ago finds him?</p> <p>\"A Final Kindness\" by D.J. Bodden - Alan Campbell was a talker, not a fighter, until someone murdered his girl. He’d almost given up on finding the killers; now he’s got a fresh lead, a trio of mercenaries who outclass him in every way but his wits. He’ll cheat, bluff, and steal to get his revenge, and as one of V.G.O.’s immortal travelers, he’s willing to die trying.</p>",

Soul-crushing medical debt. Favors to the Russian mafia. Now, asteroid. For Vlad, this is life in a nutshell.</p> <p>But, in a wild twist of fate, he has found a way out. A chance to start fresh in a brand-new ultra-immersive MMORPG called Viridian Gate Online. Making the leap might kill him, but again, death is not such a bad thing for a man with nothing to live for.</p> <p>Even in the virtual world, however, old grudges burn true, and the past is not as far gone as it seems. He must use his quick wits, rugged persistence, and peculiar set of skills as a weapons engineer to make a place for himself in this new world, or be forcibly dragged back into the very life he fought so hard to escape.</p>",

Wally Roux is a teenage genius with a big imagination and a big heart, who just moved to Savannah, GA, from Maine with his mom, who adopted him when he was an infant. In this charming and sweet solo performance, Wally investigates what is causing a number of strange events and occurrences. He explores and gets lost within space-time - an infinite, indefinable, and mysterious void that you can’t see but when you slice into it you can feel it. Part science fiction and part coming-of-age story, Wally Roux follows one boy’s journey of self-discovery and self-identity. Playwright Nick Carr was awarded a commission through the Audible Emerging Playwrights Fund, an initiative dedicated to developing innovative original plays driven by language and voice. As an Audible commissioned playwright, he received funding and creative support to develop Wally Roux, Quantum Mechanic. Note: Wally Roux contains adult language.

In fact, it almost seemed like he was a glutton for that sort of misery.</b> </p> <p>His friends were spread across two distant galaxies, separated by a heavily guarded magical portal and struggling to deal with a war now spilling over into both the technological realm as well as the magical one. And it was beginning to look like they’d reached their breaking point. </p> <p>But Charlie wasn’t about to give up, nor would he give in. If it was war they wanted, it was war they’d get, and he would cross space, and even time, if need be, to protect those he cared for. </p> <p>He would soon realize, however, that he was facing off against an adversary not only more powerful than any he’d ever battled, but one also possessing a diabolical plan worse than he’d ever imagined.</p>",

The Spirearch needs Benedict to retrieve a bag he's \"misplaced\" on the Colony Spire known as Dependence, which has strangely cut off all contact with the outside world. It's a delicate mission at best, a potential bloodbath at worst.</p> <p>To this end, the Spirearch has supplied Benedict with backup in the form of three Warriorborn. But unlike the courageous lieutenant, this trio has formerly used its special gifts for crime, carnage, and outright bloody murder. And all of them were caught and imprisoned because of Benedict. Now, if they behave—and make it back alive—they'll go free.</p> <p>But when the odd squad reaches Dependence, they soon discover something waiting for them: a horrific weapon that could shatter the balance of power among the Spires. And Benedict will have to bring his own Warriorborn skills to bear if he, his team, and Spire Albion are to have any hope of survival . . .</p>",

All they want now is to settle down, drink a few beers, and carve out a new life west of the containment wall.</p> <p>Not everyone in the IZ has such noble goals at heart, however. When the Jaeger Squad learns that another group of magic-slinging Incants are enslaving homesteaders to farm gold and harvest enchanted items to sell on the black market, they can’t just turn a blind eye. Especially since Clay and the others are the only ones with the power to make things right.</p> <p>But the Jaegers might have picked a fight too big for their newfound abilities. These Incants have had years to level up and fortify their LA stronghold. Unless the crew can unlock the dark secrets of an ancient order of eccentric monks, their dream of a new life in the wasteland might turn into a waking nightmare.</p> <p><i>From best-selling authors Eden Hudson and James Hunter comes a whole new adventure inside their Rogue Dungeon Universe.

    "description": "There's a reason We Are Legion (We Are Bob) was named Audible's Best Science Fiction Book of 2016: Its irresistibly irreverent wit! Bob Johansson has just sold his software company for a small fortune and is looking forward to a life of leisure. The first item on his to-do list: Spending his newfound windfall. On an urge to splurge, he signs up to have his head cryogenically preserved in case of death. Then he gets himself killed crossing the street. Waking up 117 years later, Bob discovers his mind has been uploaded into a sentient space probe with the ability to replicate itself. Bob and his clones are on a mission to find new homes for humanity and boldly go where no Bob has gone before.  Dennis E. Taylor’s hilarious novel sets the stage for the magnificent performance of Ray Porter, who revels in the brave new world of corpsicles, artificial intelligence, interstellar space probes, and space colonization in tantalizing detail.  We Are Legion (We Are Bob) is the first installment in the blockbuster Audible Original Bobiverse series - which has sold more than one million copies.",

Rags the goblin is heading north, seeking allies against the Goblin Lord.  And Erin is going home...or trying to, at least. She’s determined to bring back cheer to The Wandering Inn - as well as Christmas! But the coldest time of the year leads to strange encounters with a number of people.  At the same time, Ryoka Griffin is far from what she would consider to be “home”. Deep in the north, in the city of Invrisil, she finds herself as the guest of Magnolia Reinhart. She must carefully negotiate the good graces of the Deadly Flower of the North. Like Erin, her success depends on friendships made by meetings of coincidence.  Includes the story of Wistram Days, when Ceria and Pisces first meet in the Academy of Mages, Wistram.",

    "description": "<p>The ice is coming. It was the last thing we expected, but the world is freezing. A new ice age has dawned and humanity has been forced to confront its own extinction. Billions have fled the glaciers, crowding out the world’s last habitable zones. They can run from the ice, but they can’t escape human nature: a cataclysmic war is coming. </p> <p>In orbit, a group of scientists are running the Winter Experiments, a last-ditch attempt to understand why the planet is cooling. None of the climate models they build make sense. But then they discover an anomaly, an unexplained variation in solar radiation...and something else. Close to the burning edge of the sun, they catch a fleeting glimpse of something that shouldn’t be there....</p> <p>Suddenly humanity must face the possibility it is not alone in the universe. And the terrifying possibility that whatever is out there may be trying to exterminate us. </p>",

Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl.</p> <p>The Assassin, Szeth, is active again, murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin’s master has much deeper motives.</p> <p>Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined.</p> <p>Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable.</p>",

Finding his way back to Earth through a portal, John returns to a very changed world. The shackles of galactic control have bound Earth and humanity ever tighter to the system.  Now, John has to find a way to free Earth from galactic control while battling stronger, more powerful enemies. And worst of all, he will need to indulge in politics.  Good thing he's got a new class and new allies.  World Unbound is the sixth book of The System Apocalypse, a litRPG/gamelit series of post-apocalypse troubles, sci-fi and fantasy elements, all in a world filled with game mechanics. This series contains elements of games like level-ups, experience, enchanted materials, a sarcastic spirit, mecha, a beguiling dark elf, monsters, minotaurs, a fiery red head, and a semi-realistic view on violence and its effects. Does not include harems.",

Once Ruwen Starfield, he now wields the legacy of a noble bloodline—a path that leads straight into the heart of the Realm’s deepest secrets. Desperate to reclaim his humanity, Ruin must unravel the mysteries of his transformation and find a way back to who he once was.</p> <p>But the Destruction Realm has its own plans. As Ruin battles to master the powers thrust upon him, an ancient enemy manipulates the very fabric of magic, threatening to shatter the universe.

Or will he embrace his new identity to confront a destiny, and enemies, far greater than himself.</p> <p>Book 11 of the <i>Divine Apostasy</i> series, <b>Zealot's Eleventh Crusade</b> examines the complex relationships between loyalty, identity, and the relentless pursuit of balance. The stakes have never been higher, and the cost of failure is not just Ruin’s life—but the collapse of existence itself.</p>",

Over 25,000 autonomous combat drones are released in Manhattan from the hold of a ship. Hundreds of thousands are dead, and the entire island is evacuated and quarantined in just a few days' time. Ten years later, Manhattan is still empty of humans, with the exception of the salvage specialists of the most watched reality show in history: Zone War. Produced live and unedited, the show follows five teams of armored vehicle specialists who brave the active drones to recover lost riches and collect bounties on dead ones. Ram it, slam it, grab the goods, and bull your way back out. And don't break down, because no one will be coming to your aid. Armored entry is the way to go.... Unless... Meet Ajaya \"AJ\" Gurung, sniper's son, drone technician, and Zone infiltrator. Following his father's footsteps while forging ahead in ways all his own, AJ has the potential to be the most successful recovery specialist of all time. The drones are changing, the rules have been thrown out, and nothing about the Zone is what it seems. Adapt or die.",

De los crímenes se ocupan los Gremios de Ladrones y de Asesinos, sin pasarse de una cuota fija al mes, por supuesto. Así, esta guardia destartalada y sin sentido de existencia consta de tan solo tres hombres: el capitán Vimes, el sargento Colon y el cabo Nobbs. Cuando un nuevo recluta, el idealista enano de casi dos metros llamado Zanahoria Fundidordehierroson, se integra en su equipo y no tiene mejor idea que arrestar a ladrones y asesinos haciendo cumplir la Ley, los tres veteranos guardias verán cómo su rutina se rompe. Y por si fuera poco, un dragón, criatura que se creía que ya no existía, ha aparecido en la ciudad, aunque a nadie parece interesarle mucho.</p> <p><b>Please note: This audiobook is in Spanish.</b></p>",
